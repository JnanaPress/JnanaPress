# Introduction

Reading the texts and wisdom of the Ancient Hindus with their philosophical
commentaries for a western audience is the mission of JnanaPress. As a
Hindu-American when I first dove into Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism) I did not know
where to even start. I largely thought that going to a temple and praying was
basically it and did not even know the large deeply philosophical body of work
that exists. Of course my mother would watch and hear these commentaries in
Telugu, with me scratching my head as I couldn’t translate what was said. It is
for this audience that this site exists. A way to make Sanatana Dharma’s
philosophy accessible.

Sanatana Dharma is to me a choose your own adventure with both theistic and
non-theistic philosophies. It is a religion that has evolved with the history of
India with reactions and incorporations of ideas. It is a religion that says
that if another philosophy has a good idea it is totally fine to incorporate
that idea instead of being dogmatically opposed to it.

Finally, the Sanatani’s were scientific in their understanding of the nature of
reality. Many of the scriptures do not say believe this, they say test this
yourself and find out if it is true or not. As I have been going through my own
practice I have realized all this weird talk about energies and chakras do have
a basis and can be experienced.

JnanaPress uses technology, AI, and people to help archive documents. Our goal
of incorporating new documents are as follows:

1. Find out of copyright texts.
2. Quickly incorporate OCRed document into the site even if it has not been
   edited. I want to ensure that documents are available to the public as fast as
   we can make them.
3. Review original and OCRed documents.
4. Organize documents into appropriate chapters while cross linking between
   other similar documents.

The way that the site is updated may seem like a hodgepodge as I will be
incorporating documents based on my own practice so there may be a bias in terms
of which documents appear first. But I am hoping others will contribute texts
they are interested.

Thank you

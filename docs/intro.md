# Introduction

JnanaPress aims to make the philosophical wisdom of Sanatana Dharma accessible
to a Western audience, especially second-generation Hindu-Americans like myself.
Growing up, I thought Hinduism was limited to temple visits and prayers, unaware
of its vast philosophical heritage. This site bridges that gap, presenting these
teachings in an approachable way for those unfamiliar with the depth of this
tradition.

JnanaPress leverages technology, AI, and human collaboration to archive and make
accessible various texts and commentaries across Hindu traditions. Understanding
the philosophical context is crucial when reading a translated text, as the
perspective of the translator can influence interpretation. So we present
present the same text through the lens of various traditions.

Lastly, the goal is a larger one of pulling in various texts in many languages
to preserve the philosophical wisdom of Sanatana Dharma across traditions and
paths. In that regard I am looking for help from anyone who is interested in
helping out with the following goals:

1. Make texts available quickly. We want to get texts available to the public as
   fast as possible even if it means that the incorporated texts have mistakes.
   Overtime we will restructure the documents to be better formatted for the
   website.
2. Make texts available in multiple languages. We want to make sure that the
   texts are available in as many languages as possible so that people can
   access them in their native language.

Thank you

Abhi Yerra

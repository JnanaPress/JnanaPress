pronunciation; *adaksinam*, in which offerings are not made to priests as prescribed; and which is *śraddhā-virahitam*, devoid of faith.

After that, now is being stated the three kinds of austerity:

## देविजगुापूजनं शौचमाजवम्। चयमिहसं ा च शारीरं तप उयते॥१४॥

14. The worship of gods, twice-borns, venerable persons and the wise; purity, straightforwardness, celibacy and non-injury,—are said to be bodily austerity.

*Deva-dvija-guru-prājña-pūjanam*, the worship of gods, twiceborns, venerable persons and the wise; *śaucam*, purity; *ārjavam*, straightforwardness; *brahmacaryam*, celibacy; and *ahiṁsā*, noninjury; *ucyate*, are said to be; *sārīram*, bodily; *tapah*, austerity, austerity accomplished through the body: that which can be performed by the agent, etc. [\(188\)](#page--1-0), (that is) with the whole group of body and organs, in which the body predominates; for the Bhagavān will say, 'these five are its causes' (18.15).

## अनुेगकरं वायं सयं ियिहतं च यत्। वायायायसनं चैव वामयं तप उयते॥१५॥

15. That speech which causes no pain, which is true, agreeable and beneficial; as well as the practice of study of the scriptures,—is said to be austerity of speech.

*Yat*, that; *vākyam*, speech; *anudvegakaram*, which causes no pain, which is not hurtful to creatures; which is *satyam*, true; *priyahitam*, agreeable and beneficial with regard to facts seen or unseen —.

'Speech' is qualified by characteristics such as being not hurtful, etc. The *ca* (and) is used for grouping together the qualifying characteristics. When a sentence is used in order to make another understand, if it happens to be avoid of one or two or three among the qualities—truthfulness, agreeability, beneficialness, and nonhurtfulness—, then it is not austerity of speech.

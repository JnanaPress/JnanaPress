2. That which they call monasticism, know that to be Yog, O Pandava. For, nobody who has not given up expectations can be a yogī.

*Yam*, that which is characterized by the giving up of all actions and their results; which *prāhuh*, they, the knowers of the Vedas and the Smrtis, call; *sannyāsam iti*, monasticism, in the real sense; *viddhi*, known; *tam*, that monasticism in the real sense; to be *Yogm*, Yog, consisting in the performance of actions, O Pandava.

8. You perform the obligatory duties, for action is superior to inaction. And, through inaction, even the maintenance of your body will not be possible.

*Tvam*, you, O Arjuna; *kuru*, perform; *niyatam*, the obligatory; *karma*, duties, those daily obligatory duties (*nitya-karmas*) for which one is competent (according to the scriptures), and which are not

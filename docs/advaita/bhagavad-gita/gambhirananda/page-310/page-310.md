27. O son of Kuntī, whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as a sacrifice, whatever you give and whatever austerities you undertake, (all) that you offer to Me.

O son of Kuntī, *yat-karosi*, whatever you do, what comes spontaneously; [\(157\)](#page--1-0) *yad-aśnāsi*, whatever you eat; and *yat-juhosi*, whatever you offer as a sacrifice, whatever sacrifices you perform be it prescribed by the Vedas or by the Smrtis; *yat-dadāsi*, whatever you give—gold, food, clarified butter, etc. to Brāhmanas and others; and *yat-tapasyasi*, whatever austerities you undertake; (all) *tat*, that; *kurusva madarpanam*, you offer to Me.

'Hear what happens to you when you act thus.'

## शुभाशुभफलैरेवं मोयसे कमबधन: ै । संयासयोगयुतामा िवमुतो मामुपैयिस॥२८॥

28. Thus, you will become free from bondages in the form of actions which are productive of good and bad results. Having your mind imbued with the Yog of renunciation and becoming free, you will attain Me.

By dedicating to Me *evam*, thus; *moksyase*, you will become free; *karma-bandhanaih*, from bondages in the form of actions — actions themselves being the bonds; *śubha-aśubha-phalaih*, which are productive of good and bad results — i.e. from actions that have desirable (*śubha*) and undesirable (*aśubha*) results (*phala*).

*Sannyāsa*, renunciation, is that which results from dedication (of actions) to Me, and that is also Yog since it involves actions. He who has his mind (*ātmā*) endowed (*yukta*) with that Yog of renunciation (*sannyāsa-Yog*) is *sannyāsa-Yog-yukta-ātmā*.

You, being such, having your mind endowed with the Yog of renunciation, and *vimuktah*, becoming free from the bonds of actions even while living; *upaisyasi*, will attain, come; *mām*, to Me, when this body falls.

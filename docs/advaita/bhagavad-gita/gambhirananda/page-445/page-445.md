do not perish; *pralaye*, during dissolution, when even Brahmā perishes.

The Bhagavān says that association of this kind between the field and the Knower of the field is the origin of all beings:

## मम योिनमह तिमन् गभंदधायहम्। सभव: सवभूतान ततो भवित भारत॥३॥

3. My womb is the great-sustainer. In that I place the seed. From that, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, occurs the birth of all things.

*Mama*, My own Māyā, that is Prakrti consisting of the three qualities, which belongs to Me; is the *yonih*, womb [\(132\)](#page--1-0) for all the creatures. Since it (Prakrti) is great (*mahat*) as compared with all its effects, and it is the sustainer (*brahma*) [\(133\)](#page--1-1) of all its own transformations, therefore the womb itself is qualified as *mahat brahma*. *Tasmin*, in that, in the womb which is the great-sustainer; *aham*, I, Bhagavān, possessed of the power in the form of the two aspects, viz. the field and the Knower of the field; *dadhāmi*, place, deposit; *garbham*, the seed—the seed of the birth of Hiranyagarbha, the seed which is the cause of the birth of all things—; that is, I bring the field into association with the Knower of the field who conforms to the nature of the limiting adjuncts, viz. ignorance, desire and activity.

*Tatah*, from that, from that deposition of the seed; O scion of the Bharata dynasty, *bhavati*, occurs; *sambhavah*, the birth, origination; *sarva-bhūtānām*, of all things, following the birth of Hiranyagarbha.

## सवयोिनषु कौतेय मूतय: सभवित या:। तास महोिनरहं बीजद: िपता॥४॥

4. O son of Kuntī, whatever forms are born from all the wombs, of them the great-sustainer is the womb; I am the father who deposits the seed.

O son of Kuntī, *yāh*, whatever; *mūrtayah*, forms—that have their parts and limbs integrated, which is characteristic of the formation of

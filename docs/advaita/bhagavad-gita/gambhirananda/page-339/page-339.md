## *CHAPTER 11 REVELATION OF THE COSMIC FORM*

िवपदशनयोगः

The divine manifestations of the Bhagavān have been stated. And in that connection, after having heard what was said by the Bhagavān, 'I remain sustaining this whole creation in a special way by a part (or Myself),' (now) wishing to directly see that primal form of Bhagavān manifested as the Universe,

*Arjuna said:*

## मदनुहाय परमं गुमयामसंितम्। यवयोतं वचतेन मोहोऽयं िवगतो मम॥१॥

1. This delusion of mine has departed as a result of that speech which is most secret and known as pertaining to the Self, and which was uttered by You for my benefit.

*Ayam*, this; *mohah*, delusion; *mama*, of mine; *vigatah*, has departed, that is, my non-discriminating idea has been removed; *tena*, as a result of that; *vacah*, speech of Yours; which is *paramam*, most, supremely; *guhyam*, secret; and *adhyātma-sanjñitam*, known as pertaining to the Self—dealing with discrimination between the Self and the non-Self; and *yat*, which; was *uktam*, uttered; *tvayā*, by You; *madanugrahāya*, for my benefit, out of favour for me.

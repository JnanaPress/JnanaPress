are difficult to overcome; *mat-prasādāt*, through My grace. *Atha cet*, if, on the other hand; *tvam*, you; *na śrosyasi*, will not listen to, will not accept, My words; *ahankārāt*, out of egotism, thinking 'I am learned'; then *vinanksyasi*, you will get destroyed, will court ruin.

And this should not be thought of by you—'I am independent. Why should I follow another's bidding?'

## यदहकार ं मािय न योय इित मयसे। िमयैष यवसायते कृ ितव िनयोयित॥५९॥

59. That you think 'I shall not fight', by relying on egotism,—vain is this determination of yours. (Your) nature will impel you!

*Yat*, that; *manyase*, you think, resolve; this—'*na yotsye*, I shall not fight'; *āśritya*, by relying; on *ahankāram*, egotism, *mithyā*, vain; is *esah*, this; *vyavasāyah*, determination; *te*, of yours; because *prakrtih*, nature, your own nature of a Ksatriya; *niyoksyati*, will impel; *tvām*, you!

## वभावजेन कौतेय िनब: वेन कमणा। कतु ं ने छिस यमोहाकिरययवशोऽिप तत्॥६०॥

60. Being bound by your own duty born of nature, O son of Kuntī, you, being helpless, will verily do that which you do not wish to do owing to indiscrimination.

And because of *nibaddhah*, being securely bound; *svena*, by your own; *karmanā*, duty; *svabhāvajena*, born of nature [\(250\)](#page--1-0) —heroism etc. as stated (in 43); O son of Kuntī, you, *avaśah*, being helpless, under another's control; *karisyasi api*, will verily do; *tat*, that duty; *yat*, which duty; you *na*, do not; *icchasi*, wish; *kartum*, to do; *mohāt*, owing to indiscrimination.

For,

ईर: सवभूतान ह ृ ेशेऽजु न ितित। ामयन् सवभूतािन याढािन मायया॥६१॥

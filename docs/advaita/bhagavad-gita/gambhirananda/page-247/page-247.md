leading to Brahman; *kaccit na*, does he not; *naśyati*, get ruined; *iva*, like; a *chinna-abhram*, scattered cloud? Or is it that he does not?

## एतमे संशयं कृ ण छे ुमहयशेषत:। वदय: संशययाय छेा न पु पते॥३९॥

39. O Krishna, You should totally eradicate this doubt of mine. For, none other than Yourself can be the dispeller of this doubt!

O Krishna, *arhasi*, You should; *aśesatah*, totally; *chettum*, eradicate, remove; *etat*, this; *saṁśayam*, doubt; *me*, of mine. *Hi*, for; *na tvad anyah*, none other than You, be he a sage or a Bhagavān; *upapadyate*, can be; *chettā*, the dispeller, the destroyer; *asya*, of this; *saṁśayasya*, doubt. Therefore you Yourself should dispel (the doubt). This is the meaning.

*Shri Hari said:*

## पाथ नवै ेह नामु िवनाशतय िवते। निह कयाणकृ किग ु ितं तात गछित॥४०॥

40. O Pārtha, there is certainly no ruin for him here or hereafter. For, no one engaged in good meets with a deplorable end, My son!

O Pārtha, *eva vidyate*, there is certainly; *na vināśah*, no ruin; *tasya*, for him; *iha*, here, in this world; or *amutra*, hereafter, in the other world. Ruin means a birth inferior to the previous one; that is not there for one who has fallen from Yog. Hi, for; *na kaścit*, no one; *kalyāna-krt*, engaged in good; *gacchati*, meets with; *durgatim*, a deplorable end; *tāta*, My son! A father is called *tāta* because he perpetuates himself (*tanoti*) through the son. Since the father himself becomes the son, therefore the son also is called *tāta*. A disciple is called putra (son). [\(86\)](#page--1-0)

But what happens to him?

ाय पु यकृ त लोकानुिषवा शाती: समा:। शुचीन ीमत गेहे योगोऽिभजायते॥४१॥

## मया हतवं जिह मा यिथा यु यव जेतािस रणे सपान्॥३४॥

34. You destroy Drona and Bhishma, and Jayadratha and Karna as also the other heroic warriors who have been killed by Me. Do not be afraid. Fight! You shall conquer the enemies in battle.

By saying, 'who have been killed by Me,' the Bhagavān names Drona and those very warriors with regard to whom Arjuna had (his) doubts.

Now then, uncertainty with regard to Drona and Bhishma is wellfounded. Drona was the teacher of the science of archery, and was equipped with heavenly weapons; and particularly, he was his (Arjuna's) own teacher and most respected. Bhishma was destined to die at will, and possessed heavenly weapons. He fought a duel with Paraśurāma and remained unvanquished. So also Jayadratha whose father was performing an austerity with the idea that anyone who made his son's head fall on the ground would have even his own head fall. Since Karna also was equipped with an unerring spear given by Indra, and was a son of the Sun, born of a maiden (Kuntī), therefore he is referred to by his own name itself.

As a mere instrument, *tvam*, you; *jahi*, destroy them; who have been *hatān*, killed; *mayā*, by Me. *Mā*, do not; *vyathisṭhāh*, be afraid of them. *Yuddhyasva*, fight. *Jetāsi*, you shall conquer; the *sapatnān*, enemies—Duryodhana and others; *rane*, in battle.

There is no end to my manifestations.

*Kuru-śresṭha*, O best of the Kurus; *hanta*, now; since, on the other hand, it is not possible to speak exhaustively of them even in a hundred years, (therefore) *prādhānyatah*, according to their importance, according as those manifestations are pre-eminent in their respective spheres; *kathayisyāmi*, I shall describe; *te*, to you; *ātma-vibhūtayah*, My own glories; which are (*hi*, indeed) *divyāh*, divine, heavenly. *Na asti* there is no; *antah*, end; *me*, to My; *vistarasya*, manifestations.

'Of those, now listen to the foremost:'

## अहमामा गुडाके श सवभूताशयिथत:। अहमािद मयं च भूतानामत एव च॥२०॥

20. O Guḍākeśa, I am the Self residing in the hearts of all beings, and I am the beginning and the middle as also the end of (all) beings.

*Guḍākeśa*, O Guḍākeśa—*guḍākā* means sleep, and *īśa* means master; master of that (sleep) is *guḍākeśa*, that is one who has conquered sleep; [\(15\)](#page--1-0) or, one who has got thick hair; *aham*, I; am the *ātmā*, Self, the indwelling Self; who is to be ever-meditated on as *sarva-bhūta-āśaya [\(16\)](#page--1-1)*-*sthitah*, residing in the hearts of all beings. And, by one who is unable to do so, I am to be meditated on through the following aspects. I am capable of being meditated on (through them) because *aham*, I; am verily the *ādih*, beginning, the origin; and the *madhyam*, middle, continuance; *ca*, as also; the *antah*, end, dissolution; *bhūtānām*, of (all) beings.

'I am to be meditated upon thus also:'

## आिदयानामहं िवणु यितष रिवरशं ुमान्। मरीिचमतामिम नाणामहं शशी॥२१॥

21. Among the Ādityas [\(17\)](#page--1-2) I am Visnu; among the luminaries, the radiant sun; among the (forty-nine) Maruts [\(18\)](#page--1-3) I am Marīci; among the stars I am the moon.

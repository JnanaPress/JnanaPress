*viśisyate*, excels; *karma-sannyāsāt*, over mere renunciation of actions.

Thus He extols Karma-Yog. [\(50\)](#page--1-0)

Why? In answer the Bhagavān says:

## ेय: स िनयसंयासी यो न ेि न कित। िनो िह महाबाहो सुखं बधामु यते॥३॥

3. He who does not hate and does not crave should be known as a man of constant renunciation. For, O mighty-armed one, he who is free from duality becomes easily freed from bondage.

That performer of Karma-Yog, *yah*, who; *na dvesṭi*, does not hate anything; and *na kānksati*, does not crave; *jñeyah*, should be known; as *nitya-sannyāsī*, a man of constant [\(51\)](#page--1-1) renunciation. The meaning is that he who continues to be like this in the midst of sorrow, happiness and their sources should be known as a man of constant renunciation, even though engaged in actions.

*Hi*, for; *mahābāho*, O mighty-armed one; *nirdvandvah*, one who is free from duality; *pramucyate*, becomes freed; *sukham*, easily, without trouble; *bandhāt*, from bondage.

It is reasonable that in the case of renunciation and Karma-Yog, which are opposed to each other and can be undertaken by different persons, there should be opposition even between their results; but it cannot be that both of them surely lead to Liberation. When such a question arises, this is the answer stated:

## सययोगौ पृथबाला: वदित न पिडता:। एकमयािथत: सयगुभयोिवदते फलम्॥४॥

4. The fools, not the learned ones, speak of Sānkhya (the path of Knowledge) and (Karma-) Yog as different. Any one who properly resorts to even one (of them) gets the result of both.

*Bālāh*, the fools; *na panḍitāh*, not the learned ones; *pravadanti*, speak of; *sānkhya-Yogu*, Sānkhya [\(52\)](#page--1-2) (the Path of Knowledge) and

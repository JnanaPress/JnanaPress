*abhijāyate*, springs; *krodhah*, anger. *Krodhāt*, from anger; *bhavati*, follows; *sammohah*, delusion, absence of discrimination with regard to what should or should not be done. For, an angry man, becoming deluded, abuses even a teacher.

*Sammohāt*, from delusion; (comes) *smrti-vibhramah*, failure of memory originating from the impressions acquired from the instructions of the scriptures and teachers. When there is an occasion for memory to rise, it does not occur. *Smrti-bhramśāt*, from that failure of memory; (results) *buddhi-nāśah*, loss of understanding.

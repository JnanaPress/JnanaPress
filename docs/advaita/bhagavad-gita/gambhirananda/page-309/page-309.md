25. Votaries of the gods reach the gods; the votaries of the manes go to the manes; the worshippers of the Beings reach the Beings; and those who worship Me reach Me.

*Deva-vratāh*, votaries of the gods, those whose religious observances [\(156\)](#page--1-0) and devotion are directed to the gods; *yānti*, reach, go to; *devān*, the gods. *Pitr-vratāh*, the votaries of the manes, those who are occupied with such rites as obsequies etc., who are devoted to the manes; go *pitṝn*, to the manes such as Agnisvātta and others. *Bhūtejyāh*, the worshippers of the Beings; reach *bhūtāni*, the Beings such as Vināyaka, the group of Sixteen (divine) Mothers, the Four Sisters, and others. And *madyājinah*, those who worship Me, those who are given to worshipping Me, the devotees of Visnu; reach *mām*, Me alone. Although the effort (involved) is the same, still owing to ignorance they do not worship Me exclusively. Thereby they attain lesser results. This is the meaning. 'Not only do My devotees get the everlasting result in the form of non-return (to this world), but My worship also is easy.' How?

## पं पु पं फलं तोयं यो मे भया यछित। तदहं भयुपह ृ तमािम यतामन:॥२६॥

26. Whoever offers Me with devotion—a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water, I accept that (gift) of the pure-hearted man which has been devotionally presented.

*Yah*, whoever; *prayaccati*, offers; *me*, Me; *bhaktyā*, with devotion; *patram*, a leaf; *puspam*, a flower *phalam*, a fruit; or *toyam*, water; *aśnāmi*, I accept; *tat*, that (gift)—leaf etc.; *prayata-ātmanah*, of the pure-hearted man; which has been *bhakti-upahrtam* devotionally presented.

Since this is so, therefore—

यकरोिष यदािस यजुहोिष ददािस यत्। यपयिस कौतेय तकु व मदपणम्॥२७॥

This path of Liberation has not been opened recently. What then? Even in earlier days—

## वीतरागभयोधा ममया मामुपािता:। बहवो ानतपसा पूता मावमागता:॥१०॥

10. Many who were devoid of attachment, fear and anger, who were absorbed in Me, who had taken refuge in Me, and were purified by the austerity of Knowledge, have attained My state.

*Bahavah*, many; *vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhāh*, who were devoid of attachment, fear and anger; *manmayāh*, who were absorbed in Me, who were knowers of Brahman, who were seers of (their) identity with Bhagavān; *mām upāśritāh*, who had taken refuge only in Me, the supreme Bhagavān, that is who were steadfast in Knowledge alone; and were *pūtāh*, purified, who had become supremely sanctified; *jñāna-tapasā*, by the austerity of Knowledge—Knowledge itself, about the supreme Reality, being the austerity; becoming sanctified by that austerity of Knowledge—; *āgatāh*, have attained; *madbhāvam*, My state, Bhagavānhood, Liberation.

The particular mention of 'the austerity of Knowledge' is to indicate that steadfastness in Knowledge does not depend on any other austerity.

'In that case, You have love and aversion, because of which You grant the state of identity with Yourself only to a few but not to others?'

The answer is:

## ये यथा म पते ततथैव भजायहम्। मम वमनुवतते मनु या: पाथ सवश:॥११॥

11. According to the manner in which they approach Me, I favour them in that very manner. O son of Prthā, human beings follow My path in every way.

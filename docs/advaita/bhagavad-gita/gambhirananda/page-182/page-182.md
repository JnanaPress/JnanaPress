*Viddhi*, know; *tān*, them; *sarvān*, all; to be *karmajān*, born of action, accomplished through the activities of body, speech and mind, but not born of the Self. For the Self is actionless. Hence, *jñātvā*, knowing; *evam*, thus; *vimoksyase*, you will become liberated from evil. By knowing thus—'These are not my actions; I am actionless and detached'—You will be freed from worldly bondage as a result of this full enlightenment. This is the purport.

Through the verse beginning with, 'The ladle is Brahman' etc., complete Illumination has been represented as a sacrifice. And sacrifices of various kinds have been taught. With the help of [\(35\)](#page--1-0) those (sacrifices) that are meant for accomplishing desirable human ends, Knowledge (considered as a sacrifice) is being extolled:

This is the idea, which accords with the Upanisadic text, 'As when the (face of a die) bearing the number 4, called *Krta*, wins, the other inferior (numbers on the die-faces) get included in it, so whatever good actions are performed by beings, all that gets merged

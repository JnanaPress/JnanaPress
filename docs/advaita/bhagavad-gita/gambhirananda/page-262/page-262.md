deludes all beings. That is to say, they become freed from the bondage of the world.

'If it is that those who resort to You cross over this Māyā, why then do not all take refuge in You alone?' This is being answered:

## न म द ु कृ ितनो मूढा: पते नराधमा:। माययाऽपह ृ ताना आसुरं भावमािता:॥१५॥

15. The foolish evildoers, who are the most depraved among men, who are deprived of (their) wisdom by Māyā, and who resort to demoniacal ways, do not take refuge in Me.

*Mūḍhāh*, the foolish; *duskrtinah*, evildoers, sinners; who are *naraadhamāh*, the most depraved among men; who are also *apa-hrtajñānāh*, deprived of, despoiled of (their) wisdom; *māyayā*, by Māyā; and *āśritāh*, who resort to; *āsuram bhāvam*, demoniacal, ways, such as cruelty, untruthfulness, etc.; *na*, do not; *prapadyante*, take refuge; *mām*, in Me, the supreme Bhagavān.

## चतुिवधा भजते म जना: सुकृ ितनोऽजु न। आत िजासुरथथ ानी च भरतषभ॥१६॥

16. O Arjuna, foremost of the Bharata dynasty, four classes of people of virtuous deeds adore Me: the afflicted, the seeker of Knowledge, the seeker of wealth and the man of Knowledge.

Again, O Arjuna, foremost of the Bharata dynasty, *caturvidhāh*, four classes; of *janāh*, people; who are eminent among human beings and are pious in actions, and are *sukrtinah*, of virtuous deeds; *bhajante*, adore; *mām*, Me; *ārtah*, the afflicted—one who is overcome by sorrow, who is in distress, [\(101\)](#page--1-0) being overwhelmed by thieves, tigers, disease, etc.; *jijñāsuh*, the seeker of Knowledge, who wants to know the reality of the Bhagavān; *arthārthī*, the seeker of wealth; and *jñānī*, the man of Knowledge, [\(102\)](#page--1-1) who knows the reality of Visnu.

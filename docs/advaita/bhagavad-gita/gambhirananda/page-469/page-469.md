How that individual Ātman, imagined as a part of Mine, enters into the world and leaves the body are being stated: *Karsati*, it draws to itself; *indriyāni*, the (sense-) organs—ear etc.; *manah-sasṭhāni*, which have the mind as their sixth; and *prakrti-sthāni*, which abide in Nature, which are located in their respective spheres such as the orifice of the ear etc.

When (does it draw the organs)?

## शरीरं यदवाोित यचायु ामतीर:। गृहीवैतािन संयाित वायुगधािनवाशयात्॥८॥

8. When the master leaves it and even when he assumes a body, he departs taking these, as wind (carries away) odours from their receptacles.

*Yat*, when; *īśvarah*, the master of the aggregate of the body etc., the individual Ātman; *utkrāmati*, leaves the body, then he draws. Thus, the second quarter of the verse is treated first for the sake of consistency. [\(161\)](#page--1-0)

*Ca api*, and even; *yat*, when; it *avāpnoti*, assumes a body other than the earlier one; then, *grhītvā*, taking; *etāni*, these, the organs with the mind as their sixth; *saṁyāti*, he leaves, goes away totally. [\(162\)](#page--1-1) Like what? In reply the Bhagavān says: *iva*, as; *vāyuh*, the wind (carries away); *gandhān*, odours; *āśayāt*, from their receptacles flowers etc.

Which, again, are those (organs)?

## ों चु: पशनं च रसनं ाणमेव च। अिधाय मनायं िवषयानुपसेवते॥९॥

9. This one enjoys the objects by presiding over the ear, eyes, skin and tongue as also the nose and the mind.

Seated in the body, it *upasevate*, enjoys; *visayān*, the objects sound etc.; *adhisṭhāya*, by presiding over; *śrotram*, the ear; *caksuh*, eyes; *sparśanam*, skin, the organ of touch; *rasanam*, tongue; *eva ca*,

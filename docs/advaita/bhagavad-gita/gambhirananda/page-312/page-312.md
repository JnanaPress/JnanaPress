## िं भवित धममा शछाितं िनगछित। कौतेय ितजानीिह न मे भत: णयित॥३१॥

31. He soon becomes possessed of a virtuous mind; he attains everlasting peace. Do you proclaim boldly, O son of Kuntī, that My devotee does not get ruined.

Having given up his external evil behaviour due to the strength of his internal proper resolves, *ksipram bhavati*, he soon becomes; verily *dharma-ātmā*, possessed of a virtuous mind; and *nigaccahti*, he attains; *śaśvat*, everlasting; *śāntim*, peace, quietude [\(159\)](#page--1-0). O son of Kuntī, listen to the supreme Truth: *Pratijānīhi*, do you proclaim boldly, make a firm declaration; that *me*, My; *bhaktah*, devotee, who has dedicated his inner being to Me; *na*, does not; *pranasyati*, get ruined.

Moreover,

## म िह पाथ यपािय ये ऽिप यु: पापयोनय:। ियो वैयातथा शूाते ऽिप याित पर गितम्॥३२॥

32. For, O son of Prthā, even those who are born of sin—women, Vaiśyas, as also Śūdras [\(160\)](#page--1-1)—, even they reach the highest Goal by taking shelter under Me.

*Hi*, for; O son of Prthā, *ye api*, even those; *pāpayonayah syuh*, who are born of sin;—as to who they are, the Bhagavān says *striyah*, women; *vaiśyāh*, Vaiśyas, *tathā*, as also; *śūdrāh*, Śūdras; *te api*, even they; *yānti*, reach, go to; the *parām*, highest; *gatim*, Goal; *vyapāśritya*, by taking shelter; *mām*, under Me—by accepting Me as their refuge.

## िकं पुनणा: पु या भता राजषयतथा। अिनयमसुखं लोकिममं ाय भजव माम्॥३३॥

33. What to speak of the holy Brāhmanas as also of devout kindsages! Having come to this ephemeral and miserable world, do you worship Me.

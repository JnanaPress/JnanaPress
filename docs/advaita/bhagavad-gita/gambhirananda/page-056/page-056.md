17. But know That to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded. None can bring about the destruction of this Immutable.

*Tu*, but—this word is used for distinguishing (reality) from unreality; *tat viddhi*, know That; to be *avināśi*, indestructible, by nature not subject to destruction; what? (that) *yena*, by which, by which Brahman called Reality; *sarvam*, all; *idam*, this, the Universe together with space; is *tatam*, pervaded, as pot etc. are pervaded by space. *Na kaścit*, none; *arhati*, can; *kartum*, bring about; *vināśam*, the destruction, disappearance, non-existence; *asya*, of this *avyayasya*, of the Immutable, that which does not undergo growth and depletion.

Brahman surely does not suffer loss like Devadatta suffering from loss of wealth. Therefore no one can bring about the destruction of this immutable Brahman. No one, not even Bhagavān Himself, can destroy his own Self, because the Self is Brahman. Besides, action with regard to one's Self is selfcontradictory.

18. These destructible bodies are said to belong to the everlasting, indestructible, indeterminable, embodied One. Therefore, O descendant of Bharata, join the battle.

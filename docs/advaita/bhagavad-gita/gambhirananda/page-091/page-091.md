What happens when there is serenity? This is being answered:

## सादे सवद: ु खान हािनरयोपजायते। सचेतसो ाशु बुि: पयवितते॥६५॥

66. For the unsteady there is no wisdom, and there is no meditation for the unsteady man. And for an unmeditative man there is no peace. How can there be happiness for one without peace?

*Ayuktasya*, for the unsteady, for one who does not have a concentrated mind; *na asti*, there is no, that is, there does not arise; *buddhih*, wisdom, with regard to the nature of the Self; *ca*, and; there is no *bhāvanā*, meditation, earnest longing [\(107\)](#page--1-1) for the knowledge of the Self; *ayuktasya*, for an unsteady man. And similarly, *abhāvayatah*, for an unmeditative man, who does not ardently desire

15. Others verily worship Me by adoring exclusively through the sacrifice of the knowledge of oneness; (others worship Me) multifariously, and (others) as the multiformed existing variously.

*Aham*, I; am the *kratuh*, a kind of Vedic sacrifice; I Myself am the *yajñah*, sacrifice as prescribed by the Smrtis; further, I am *svadhā*, the food that is offered to the manes; I am *ausadham*—by which word is meant the food that is eaten by all creatures. Or, *svadhā* means food in general of all creatures, and *ausadha* means medicine for curing diseases. I am the *mantra* with which offering is

the body, or (as others hold) that Bhagavān is merely a stone or wood—, remaining confined thus to one form; *ahaitukam*, which is irrational, bereft of logic; *a-tattvārthavat*, not concerned with truth *tattvārtha*, truth, means something just as it is; that (knowledge) which has this (truth) as its object of comprehension is *tattvārthavat*; that without this is; *a-tattvārthavat*—; and which, on account of the very fact of its being irrational, is *alpam*, trivial, because it is concerned with trifles or is productive of little result. This kind of knowledge is indeed found in non-discriminating creatures in whom *tamas* predominates.

Now is being stated the threefold division of action:

## य ु कामेसुना कम साहकार ं ेण वा पुन:। ियते बहल ु ायासं ताजसमुदाह ृ तम्॥२४॥

24. But that action is said to be born of *rajas* which is done by one desirous of results or by one who is egotistic, and which is highly strenuous.

But *tat*, that; *karma*, action; *udāhrtam*, is said to be; *rājasam*, born of *rajas*; *yat*, which; is *kriyate*, done; *kāmepsunā* by one desirous of results; *vā*, or; *saahankārena*, by one who is egotistic; and *bahula-*

*Shri Hari said—*

## अरं परमं वभावोऽयाममु यते। भूतभावोवकरो िवसग : कमसंित:॥३॥

3. The Immutable is the supreme Brahman; self-hood is said to be the entity present in the individual plane. By action is meant the offerings which bring about the origin of the existence of things.

*Aksaram* means that which does not perish (*na ksarati*), the supreme Self. This agrees with the Upanisadic text, 'Under the mighty rule of this Immutable, O Gārgī...' (Br. 3.8.9). And (the letter) *Om* is not accept here [as the meaning of *aksara* (lit. letter)], because of its being mentioned (as a *letter*) later on in, 'The single letter *Om*, which is Brahman' (13). Besides, the adjective 'supreme' is more appropriate with regard to the absolute, immutable Brahman.

By *svabhāva*, self-hood, is meant the existence of that very supreme Brahman in every body as the indwelling Self. *Svabhāvah ucyate*, self-hood is said to be, is referred to by the word; *adhyātmam*, the entity which, as the indwelling Self, exists in the body (*ātmā*) by making it its habitat (*adhikrtya*), and which in the ultimate analysis is the supreme Brahman.

*Visargah*, the offerings, the giving away to gods of things like porridge, [\(111\)](#page--1-0) cake, etc.; *bhūta-bhāva-udbhava-karah*, which bring about the origin of the existence of things; is *karma-sanjñitah*, meant by *action*. This sacrifice consisting in pouring of oblations is called action. The existence (*bhāva*) of (moving and non-moving) things (*bhūta*) is *bhūta-bhāva*. The coming into being (*udbhava*) of that (existence) is *bhūta-bhāva-udbhavah*. That which causes (*karoti*) this is *bhūta-bhāva-udbhava-karah*, that is the originator of existing things. It is indeed from this source that all beings, moving and nonmoving, originate through the successive processes of rainfall etc. (see 3.14-15).

26. These two courses of the world, which are white and black, are verily considered eternal. By the one a man goes to the State of Non-return; by the other he returns again.

*Ete*, these two; *gatī*, courses; *jagatah*, of the world; which are *śukla-krsne*, white and black [\(124\)](#page--1-0)—white because it is a revealer of Knowledge, and black because there is absence of that (revelation); are *hi*, verily; *mate*, considered; *śāśvate*, eternal, because the world is eternal. These two courses are possible for those who are qualified for Knowledge and for rites and duties; not for everybody. This being so, *ekayā*, by the one, by the white one; *yāti*, a man goes; *anāvrttim*, to the State of Non-return; *anyayā*, by the other; *āvartate*, he returns; *punah*, again.

## नतै े सृती पाथ जानयोगी मुित कन। तमासवषु कालेषु योगयुतो भवाजु न॥२७॥

27. O son of Prthā, no yogī [\(125\)](#page--1-1) whosoever has known these two courses becomes deluded. Therefore, O Arjuna, be you steadfast in Yog at all times.

O son of Prthā, *na kaścana yogī*, no yogī whosoever; *jānan*, has known; *ete srtī*, these two courses as described—that one leads to worldly life, and the other to Liberation; *muhyati*, becomes deluded. *Tasmāt*, therefore; O Arjuna, *bhava*, be you; *Yog-yuktah*, steadfast in Yog; *sarvesu kālesu*, at all times.

Hear about the greatness of that Yog:

वेदेषु येषु तप:सु चैव दानषे ु यपु यफलं िदम्। अयेित तसविमदं िविदवा योगी परं थानमुपैित चाम्॥२८॥

28. Having known this, the yogī transcends all those results of righteous deeds that are declared with regard to the Vedas,

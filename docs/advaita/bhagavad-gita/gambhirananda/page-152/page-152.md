the Brāhmana caste. The protection of the world becomes ensured when the Brāhmanas and the Ksatriyas are protected.

It (this Yog) is *avyayam*, imperishable, because its result is undecaying. For, the result—called Liberation—of this (Yog), which is characterized by steadfastness in perfect Illumination, does not decay. And he, Vivasvān, *prāha*, taught (this); *manave*, to Manu. Manu *abravīt*, transmitted (this); *iksvākave*, to Iksvāku, his own son who was the first king. [\(1\)](#page--1-0)

## एवं परपराातिममं राजषयो िवद: ु । स कालेनहे महता योगो न: परतप॥२॥

2. The king-sages knew this (Yog) which was received thus in regular succession. That Yog, O destroyer of foes, in now lost owing to a long lapse of time.

*Rājarsayah*, the king-sages, those who were kings and sages (at the same time); *viduh*, knew; *imam*, this Yog; which was *evam paramparā-prāptam*, received thus through a regular succession of Ksatriyas. *Sah*, that; *Yogh*, Yog; *nasṭah*, is lost, has got its traditional line snapped; *iha*, now; *mahatā kālena*, owing to a long lapse of time; *parantapa*, O destroyer of foes. By *para* are meant those against oneself. He who, like the sun, 'scorches' (*tāpayati*) them by the 'rays' of the 'heat' of his prowess is *parantapa*, that is scorcher of antagonists.

Noticing that the Yog has got lost by reaching people who are weak and have no control of their organs, and that the world has become associated with goals that do not lead to Liberation,

## स एवायं मया ते ऽ योग: ोत: पुरातन:। भतोऽिस मे सखा चेित रहयं ेतद ु मम्॥३॥

3. That ancient Yog itself, which is this, has been taught to you by Me today, considering that you are My devotee and friend. For, this (Yog) is a profound secret.

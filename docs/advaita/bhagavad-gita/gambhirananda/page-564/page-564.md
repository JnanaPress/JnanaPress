56. Ever engaging even in all actions, one to whom I am the refuge, attains the eternal, immutable State through My grace.

*Sadā*, ever; *kurvānah api*, engaging even in; *sarva-karmāni*, all actions, even the prohibited ones; *madvyapāśrayah*, one to whom I am the refuge, to whom I, Vāsudeva the Bhagavān, am the refuge, that is one who has totally surrendered himself to Me; even he, *āpnoti*, attains; the *śāśvatam*, eternal; *avyayam*, immutable; *padam*, State of Visnu; *mat-prasādāt*, through My, that is Bhagavān's grace.

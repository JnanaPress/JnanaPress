they; *matāh*, are considered; to be *yukta-tamāh*, most perfect yogīs; *me*, according to Me, for they spend days and nights with their minds constantly fixed on Me. Therefore, it is proper to say with regard to them that they are the best yogīs.

'Is it that the others do not become the best yogīs?' 'No, but listen to what has to be said as regards them:'

*Upāsanā*, meditation, means approaching an object of meditation as presented by the scriptures, and making it an object of one's own thought and dwelling on it uniterruptedly for long by continuing the same current of thought with regard to it—like a line of pouring oil.

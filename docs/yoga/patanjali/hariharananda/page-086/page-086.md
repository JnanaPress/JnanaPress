## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATANJALI

being prompted by Him is what is known as surrendering everything to God. The saying "Whatever I do, willingly or unwillingly, I am offering its fruits, whether happiness or misery, to you" means that "I do not want either happiness or sorrow nor shall be perturbed by either. Everything is being done by you." To make oneself disinterested in everything one should do this devotional practice. This frame of mind banishes all egotistic feeling and brings about a perpetual faith in God.

(2) Being touched by his devotion, God desires that the wishes of a wholehearted and dependent devotee might be fulfilled. Naturally God's grace would be directed towards conferment of the highest benefit to all created beings, viz. attainment of Moksa or a state of liberation and not worldly pleasures, which it is best not to seek from God. Worldly pleasures or misery arise out of work done. From work such as Isvara-Pranidhana, spiritual knowledge is obtained through God's grace. Through contemplation on God as on a liberated person the mind naturally becomes calm and thereby concentrated. From knowledge derived through concentration, the spiritual needs of a Yogin are met. He has not" to wait for special favour from God ; while Yogins who surrender all the fruits of their labour to God and seek knowledge from Him get it through His grace.

#### YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATANJALI

with truthful subjects and the thought of telling a lie does not occur even for saving one's life, then it is certain that one's will-force conveyed by one's speech will be infallible. Disease or habit of lying or timidity can be cured by hypnotic suggestions. Similarly, the strongly developed will-power of a Yogin can produce feeling in the mind of the hearer in accordance with his uttered words and weaken the opposing thoughts. Thus when he says 'Be virtuous' it leads to the manifestation of the latency of virtue and makes the hearer virtuous. Yogins, however, do not entertain fruitless resolutions beyond the reach of their power.

# स्वस्तियप्रतिष्ठायां सर्वरत्नोपस्थानम् ॥ ३७ ॥ भाष्यम् - सवदिकस्यान्यस्योपतिष्ठन्ते रत्नानि ॥ ३७ ॥

#### When Non-Stealing Is Established All Jewels Present Themselves. 37.

### Jewels from all directions come to him (1).

(1) On the establishment of non-stealing, i.e. non-covetuousness such look of indifference radiates from the devotee's face that any being looking at him regards him as greatly trustworthy and donors consider themselves as fortunate in being able to make a present to him of their best things. Thus, as the yogin roams from place to place jewels (best of things) from different quarters reach him. Fascinated by the powers of the yogin and considering him as a source of great consolation, the jewels among the conscious beings, appear before him personally while inanimate precious things are brought to him by donors. The word Ratna or jewel implies the best of every class (animate or inanimate).

भाष्यम-यस्य लाभाद्रप्रतिघानू गुणानुत्वर्षयति, सिद्यय विनेयेषु ज्ञान-माधातु' समर्थो भवतीति ॥३८॥

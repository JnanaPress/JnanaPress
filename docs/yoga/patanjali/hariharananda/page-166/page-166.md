## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATAÑJALI

seer of 'I') is also a form of manifest condition. There is further similarity with the parched seed. As the parched seed looks like an ordinary seed but its power of sprouting ceases, so Kleśa in a subtle state exists but produces no modification of offspring ; i.e. no afflictive mental fluctuation then takes place but only that of perfect knowledge. At the root of modification based on knowledge, however, there exists egoism in a subtle form, which is the thin state of Klesa.

The Klesa so reduced disappears with the disappearance of the mind. When through Para-Vairagya or supreme renunciation the mind merges into its constituent causes, the subtle Klesas then become unmanifest also along with it. Pralaya or Vilaya implies disappearance without chance of re-emergence. In ordinary circumstances afflictive modifications taking place in the mind determine the births, span of life and the experience (embodiment etc.). Klesas are attenuated by Kriya-Yoga. Although in Samprajnata Yoga, relationship with the body no doubt continues, that relationship is based on such knowledge as 'I am not the body etc.' This is the subtle state of Klesa. It is needless to say that it stops birth, span of life and further experience. In Asamprajnata-yoga that subtle relationship with body also ceases i.e. the modifications being merged in their natural causes Klesas are completely destroyed.

Moreover Of Klesas Remaining As Germs, Their Means Of Subsistence Or Their Gross State Are Avoidable By Meditation. II.

The gross manifestations of Klesas (I) having been attenuated by Kriya-yoga they are to be destroyed

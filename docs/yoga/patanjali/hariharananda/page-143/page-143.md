knowledge *in* called memory and resurgence of the impression of tin action is called automatic action, All knowledge and action take place with the assistance of latent impressions\* l''or an ordinary mortal it is impossible to know or to do a tiling completely abandoning previous latent impressions.

Latent impressions are divisible into two classes, containing ted impressions and uncoiitaininated impressions f.ei those arising out of nescience and those pregnant with correct knowledge. As knowledge is antagonistic to nescience, the latent impressions of true knowledge destory such impressions of nescience, Knowledge derived through Sainprajhftta Samfldhi is the acme of knowledge while Discriminative knowledge is its final stage. Therefore, the latent impression of knowledge derived through Samadhi is able to destroy the latent impression of nescience. When the latent impressions of nescience get feeble, the fluctuations of the mind also are enfeebled, because attachment, hatred and such other nescience really cause the fluxes of the mind.

It has already been said (Sutra 1-16) by the commentator that knowledge culminates in detachment. That is how from the knowledge derived through Samprajflftta Samfttlhi, which is the knowledge of the fundamental principles, and Viveka-K hy&ti or Discriminative discernment detachment becomes complete.

2. Inclination towards mutation arises from the latent impressions in the mind. It might appear therefore that the latent impressions derived through Samprajhata Yoga will also dispose the mind towards such mutation\* That however is not the case. The latent impressions of **Sampraju&ta** are really such impressions as prevent the reception of objects by mind, which results in misery. As Sairiprajiiftta impressions get strongs the mind ceases to work,

3, When Samprajuata Yoga reaches its highest stage in Viveka-Khyiti or Discriminative discernment, the activity of the mind ceases. Through that, on the realisation of the distinc**tion** between BuSdhi**—**the receptacle of all sorrows—and Purina, the immutable cogniser, the highest form of detachment is achieved and the mind censing to act, the Seer is said to be in a state of Kaivalya or isolation.

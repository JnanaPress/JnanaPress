## **'To O&c Established In Tbt Disceramcot Between Buddhi And Purusa Comes Omnipotence and Omniscience. 49,**

When Buddhl-Sattwa or intellect, being freed from the lain! of Rajas and Tamas, attains perfection and becomes transparently clear, in that extreme Vasilcara-Sahjfia state, the yogin's mind established in the knowledge of the distinction between the #uddhi-Sattwa and the Purusa, **acquires** power over all phases of existence (1), *i.e.* all objective and subjective forms of the (iunas appear before his mind's **eye** in an infinite variety. Omniscience means simultaneous knowledge of all-pervading Gunas in their past, present and future states of existence, it is called Vivekaja Jhana. Jliis attainment is called Visoka and on acquiring this, the yogin becomes all-knowing and free from all afllictions.

**(J) Having spoken of attainments in knowledge ami then in action, the commentator speaks of how both kinds L\*f itttailiment can be fully developed.**

**The yogin whose mind i> full of discriminative discernment, becomes omniscient and omnipotent. Omniscience implies simultaneous knowledge of all past, present and future characteristics of all tilings. Omnipotence implies contact with all phases of things, they being kuowflble all at the same time.** *Ax* **the seer coming into contact with the Huddhi as an object, brings it under his control so by establishing Contact with the basic principle everything comes under his Control. In this connection it is said in the £ruti that when tlic Puriiga is realised, omniscience is acquired.**

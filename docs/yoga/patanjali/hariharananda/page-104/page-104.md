## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATAÑJALI

च्चोभः । यदंगान्येजयति कम्पयति तदृङ्गमेजयत्वम् । प्राणो यद्यान्ध्रं वायु-माचामति स श्रतास:, यत् कौण्यवायुं निःसारयति स प्रश्नास:, एते विश्वेष-सन्दर्भुवो विचित्तस्यैते भवन्ति समान्ति समान्ति न भवन्ति ॥ २१ ॥

## Sorrow, Dejection, Restlessness, Inhalation And Exhalation Arise From (Previous) Distractions. 31.

Sorrow is of three kinds-Adhyatmika (arising within oneself), Adhibhautika (inflicted by some other creature) or Adhidaivika (through natural calamity). Upset by which creatures try to stop it, i.e. remedy it-that is sorrow. Dejection is caused through nonfulfilment of desire or when wished-for things do not happen. The upsetting of bodily equilibrium or steadiness results in shakiness of the body. The ordinary process of taking in the breath and exhaling the same (1) is also a companion of mental distraction. These disturbances generally take place in a restless state of the mind. They do not appear in a reposeful mind.

(1) The natural process of inhalation and exhalation is referred to here. When this is done unconsciously or unwillingly it is detrimental to concentration. The regulated breathing, i.e. fixed inhalation and exhalation which is practised for bringing about concentration through Pranayama is not likely to produce disturbance or obstacles. In complete concentration, breathing generally stops but the flow of inner consciousness resulting from Praņāyāmic breathing continues and if recollection thereof is consciously maintained, it brings about concentration on that object.

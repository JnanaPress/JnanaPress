identity with the knowledge about the cow nor with the animal itself, because any name might indicate an animal with such properties. Therefore the three factors-name, the object indicated and knowing-are entirely distinct. But generally the name is taken as the thing named and both are identified with the knowledge of the object also. Therefore in spite of the fact that there is no identity of the three factors, the confused idea of their sameness that follows the utterance of the name is called Vikalpa. Thus our ordinary thought is about the word, the object and the idea-all mixed up. Because in this process an unavoidable error, in the shape of Vikalpa is present, it is imperfect cognition and is therefore not the higher and true Yogic perception. data in ad insmerberged and

It is, however, in this way that the Yogin's knowledge is gained at first. As a result, the Yogic knowledge that is derived through the process of meditation with the help of words is called Savitarkā Samāpatti.

The maker of the Sutra has analysed this Samapatti to indicate its difference from Nirvitarka Samapatti described later. When Savitarka Samapatti is practised in respect of 'cow', all knowledge regarding the cow will be obtained and it will come with the help of words, e.g. whose cow, what sort of a cow, etc. etc.

Of course Yogins do not direct their contemplation to the acquisition of knowledge in respect of a cow. The real object of engrossment for the acquisition of knowledge is in respect of the elemental principles and other realities, through which detachment is developed, which gradually leads to the gaining of the state of isolation.

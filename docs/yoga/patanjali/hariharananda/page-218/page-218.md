## **YOGA PHILOSOPHY O\* PATA^JALJ**

When this is activated by the action called 'light', the concept of light is formed. Knowledge of light means the conception of identity between the knower and tile sensation of light. In other words\* an external activity producing a change in the T-sense being attributed to the knower, is knowledge of light\* This feeling of relationship between the knower and the known, r.fl. *\*1* am the knower of lights is the ego called 'Asmitl'. The nature of the sense-organ\* or their common constituent, is the sixth Avise^a or tindiversified principle called Asmitfi\*

(.S) Self only as cognition of unqualified existence — the feeling that \*1 exist" or pure 'T-sense- The property of Huddhi or Mnhat as a principle is assurance\* Assurance and existence as entity arc inseparable. Assurance in respect oT a thing and that of self arc both attributes of Timid hi, Of these, the assurance in respect of self *is* the final. That is why it is the real nature of ttnddhi.

The perceptible part of sound etc. is only a modification of our ego. and tile external action from which sound etc. emanate, is a mutation of the ego of the Great Ilruhma or Hirauyngarbha. Thus sound etc. are in both respects the modifications of the ego.

The commentator says that Mahat undergoes six undivemified modifications iu the shape of Taumitra and ego. Sflrbkhyn says that from Mahat arises ego and from ego come the five Tanmatras\* Some say that this is a point of difference between the S&mkhyA and Yoga philosophies\* There is\* however, no real difference. In fact, the observation of the commentator is this—the first manifested Mahat is antecedent to the six Avisefas or undiverted slates\* Taking the latter states as one species\* the first

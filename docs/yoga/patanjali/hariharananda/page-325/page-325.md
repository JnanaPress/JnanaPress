That which is unfit for direct perception or is subtle, we designate as past or future. Thus there is no chance of the manifest Ixdng given the three symptoms.

Herein the commentator has explained that even when *<sup>a</sup>* characteristic ri not manifest, it exists\* Por example, when a mind is full of auger, it cannot be said that it has no feeling of attachment at the time\* The next moment the characteristic of attachment might, manifest itself.

*{#)* The commentator having explained the different states, proceeds to refute the objections that are raised, The critic says that when a tiling and its characteristics always remain, then a thing, its characteristic, symptom and state are everlasting like immutable Awareness, *i.f*. what is called oh! is always there in a subtle! form and what is called new i-n and will be there also. What remains always is everlastingly present ; therefore, what is called a state of change is in fact immutably everlasting\*

In reply, it is pointed out that 'everlasting' dots not necessarily imply everlasting in the same form. That which always remains in the same form is only 4Kutastlia' (or truly, i.r. immutably everlasting). The material cause of the everchsinging must be changeful. That is why, a naturally mutative entity calLd prndhftuu is mentioned as the material cause. Pradhana though everlasting is Changeful. That changing state is a form of characteristic or manifestation as Intellect etc. From the mutations, or appearance and disappearance of changes, the original cause is called chungeably everlasting.

(9) The commentutor concludes his observations by bringing out the symptoms of changes. The change of the form of ;<sup>l</sup> thing is its imitation. When wc sec that its previously noticed characteristic is not present\* we say, it lias changed.

In **respect** of subjective principles their mutation is **change** of condition in relation to time. Mental fluctuations have no spatial existence, but only covers **time.** Their change is only timely emergence or Subsidence, ;.f. the appearance of some modifications **at** one time and of others at another time. Thus alteration of cotidiiion either in reference to space or to time is change or **mutation.**

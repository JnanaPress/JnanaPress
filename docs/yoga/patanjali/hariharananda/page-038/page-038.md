That which depends on another for its manifestation is an object of knowledge. That which docs not depend on another for its revelation is the self-luminous principle of Consciousness. The Puru^a or the Seer is self-luminous, while Buddlii and other objects are revealed by something else\* They appear as conscious under the influence of Consciousness or the Self. This is the nature of Lhe subject and the object\* The subject is like the proprietor and the object is like his property\* The process of realisation of Buddhi etc. will be described later.

Hut far from Samidhi, a person having the capacity to remain buried underground for even three months at a stretch\* may not have even a remote conception of Yoga. It should be always clearly understood that Yoga primarily means control over the mind, and not merely control over the body. When the mind is wholly controlled, the body will necessarily be brought under control, but there may be full Control over the body without the least control over the mind.

When after exhalation the movement is stopped, there is an external operation of Fx&payftms. If this is done after inhalation it will be an internal operation of Pr&uAy&Tua\* Without attempting inhalation or exhalation, when the breath is partly taken or partly exhaled, to stop wholly the **function** of breathing in one single effort there is the third operation or Stambha Vrtti, in which the air in the Jungs being sucked in is gradually exhausted. Hence it is felt as if the air iu the whole body were being tucked in.

Just as water dropped on a piece oT hot stone dries up simultaneously from all sides, even so by the operation of suspension, the function of breathing slops altogether\* That is, air has not to be expelled from the body and held outside, for the purpose of stopping its flow | conversely, the movement of breath has not to be stopped by inhaling air and holding it inside the body\*

hi the initial stage\* either the external operation of FrftnilyAiiia, or the internal operation should be adopted for practice. In the Sutra (I-3-f) the author has shown preference for the practice of the external operation. Practising suspension in between, ihe breath has to be brought under control.

**After** the practice of either the external or internal operation for a time\* the effort to practise suspension (fttambha) arises. Tliis effort for suspension automatically develops when after **the** practice of cither the external or internal operation for some time a few breaths arc taken in the natural way\* By that effort, firmly stopping the breathing organs, suspension

## **Asmiti Or 'Egoism\* Is The Appearance Of Identity Of The** Purusa Or Consciousness And Buddhi, 6.

Purusa is absolute Awareness while Buddhi or the cognitive principle is the instrument of knowing. Looking upon these two as the same is the affliction known as Egoism. **When** the two utterly different entities like the expericncer and the experienced, look undivided (1) that is called experience\* **When** the real nature of the two gets known there remains only their isolatcdness and there is then no experience. So it has been said (by Acharya Panchasikha) 'Failing to sec that Purusa is different from Buddhi in Us immaculatencss, immutability and nature as consciousness\* Buddhi **through** delusion\* is regarded as the true self." 2«

(1) The experienced is of the nature of (mental) knowledge while the expericncer is of the nature of metapsychic con scionsuess ; therefore their identity is in the context of cognition. The identity of the knowe: and the known, is not to be imagined as like that of sail and water *i.e.* of (tangible) objects, It is just the non-distinction of the awareness of the Purusa and the awareness of Buddhi. \* Experience is the cognition of Buddhi and the Puxupa as identical- (Sutra III. 35)—by such statement the maker of the Sfitra has described the relation between Buddhi and Purusa. Happiness and misery are the objects of experience. They reside in the inner or subjective organs and therefore the inner organs Constitute the object of experience.

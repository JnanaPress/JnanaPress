Of these—-

## **Ahimsa {HiTmlessness), S»tya Truths Asltya (Abstention From Ste9ling}i Brahmacharya (Continence) And Apnriqritha {Non-Grasping, Abstinence From Avariciousness) Are The Five Yimdt (Forms OF Restraint). 30.**

Of these Ahimsa (1) is non\*injuring all beings, always and in all manners. Truth and other Forms oJ restraints and observances are based on the spirit of harmlessness. As they are the means of fulfilment of harmlessness, they have been ictummondctl in the Sastras for establishing Ahimsa\* They are also the best means of making Ahimsa pure. Thai is why it has been stated in the Sastras, 'Whatever acts of discipline an: practised by the knower of Brahman, he, thereby abstaining from acts of violence duetto misapprehension, makes Ahimsa pure, *i.e.* all his virtuous deeds result in purification of Ahimsa\*'

Satya (truthfulness) (2) is correspondence of speech and mind to fact, *i.e.* saying and thinking of what has been seen, heard or inferred. Words spoken to others for communicating one's own thoughts when not deluding or mistaken or meaningless to the hearer, are true. They should, however, be used not for inflicting harm to creatures but for their benefit ; because if words spoken hurt others, they do not produce piety as truth would, but only sin. By application of such pious looking (true) words one gets into painful darkness or infernal region. Therefore, truthful words beneficial to every creature should be uttered after careful consideration.

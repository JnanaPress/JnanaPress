sun through Nirvitnrka engrossment the Yog in reaches the subtler state of that luminosity by a special process of calming the mind and the senses, that is realisation of the light Tattuiutra or monad. At first taking into consideration the proposition that gross things arc made up of TaDinfitfua by reason and instruction and then by reflection atl<l quietening the mind, One has to proceed towards realisation, Savich&ra engrossment is conditioned by the mixture of words, the objects and their knowledge and is consequently affected by space, time, and causation\* In other words, the then location of the sun, the present or manifest Condition Ot the sun mid the present luminosity (not past and future) as observed by the eye,—all these affect the knowledge derived by **Sayich^rtL** Samapatti.

The mind is then full only of the object free of any verbal notion or Yikalpn, and this is called NirvichArA Samapfttti or super-rttflective engrossment.

Untuanifested i'rakrti cannot form the subject of Xirvicliikrii Samipatti because an unmanifested slate cannot be subject of **concentration.** Prakrti Sfs the merged or latent or potential stale of all phenomena\* An unman ifested state cannot occupy the

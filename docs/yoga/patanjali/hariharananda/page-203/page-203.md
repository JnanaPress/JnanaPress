**Uniting and separating refer to association and dissociation with Pnfn\$fl.**

**Depend on each other for producing an objector a manifesto' tiou. All objects art produced by the Gupas by tnntnal cooperation. That is, in the Sattva or Saliva predominating state, the Rajas and Tamos states also remain as auxiliaries. There is no state which is exclusively Sflltvika or exclusively Rajasika or exclusively Ttxnasika\* Everywhere there is dominance of one and subordination of the other two,**

**Just as in a rope made of red. black and white strands the three remain distinct, even so the Gnpns remain unmixed,** *i.e.* **their properties of sentience, mobility and inertia remain veparatc and each retains its characteristic even under the influence of the others\* Though tmmtxcd, they are auxiliaries to one another. That is why it is said that 'they exhibit themselves in similar and dissimilar measures etc.' Due to innumerable types of SSttvika, Riljasika and Tamasika properties innumerable types of objects are produced. Whatever Gupa is the principal ingredient of a state becomes distinctly manifest as the dominant ingredient of that state. As ancillary to it, however, other dissimilar (Timas also become its ingredients\* That is, if one Guna is dominant in a person, the other two Guuns will exist ill him in <sup>a</sup> subordinate stale. Kor example, in a celestial body, which is the product of Slttvika property, the the Rajas and Turnas powers are also present as subsidiaries.**

**During the sLate of dominance each produces its own effect. Though in certain states, certain Gun;is remain ancillary, they assert themselves when the dominant one loses force as when the king dies, the prince nearest to him gets to the throne.**

**(3) When ancillary, their presence in a secondary form can be inferred from their effects, in the knowledge of sound. Though the knowledge is predominantly an object of the Sfttlviku lype it can be inferred that Rajas And TamaS are included in it. Although activity is not directly visible, we know that no sound is possible without vibration, Therefore, vibration is auxiliary to knowledge of sound or sentience, which is dominantly Sallvihu in character.**

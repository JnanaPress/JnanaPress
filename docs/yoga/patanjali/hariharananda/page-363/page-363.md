**Experience {Of Pleanurc Or Pain; Arises From A Conception Which Does Not Distinguish Between The Two Extremely Different Entities^ vit. Buddhisittwa And Purusa. Such Experience Exists For Another (jhe, Purusa). That Is Why Through Samyarua On The Distinction Between Buddhi And Purusa, A Knowledge Regarding Purusa Is Acquired, 3S.**

Buddhisattwa or Intellect is sentient. With it arc related inseparably Rajas and Tanias Gunas. By subduing or counteracting the force of the two latter, Buddhisattwa proceeds to realise the distinction between Baddhi and Purusa (1).

Purusa is altogether different in nature from Buddhi. He is pine, distinct and absolute consciousness- Conception ofthe two distinct entities {Buddhisattwa and Purusa) as the same, is experience (Bhoga) and it is ascribed to Purusa, because in reality what is seen or experienced is presented to Purusa by the Buddhi, The conception of experience is of the Intellect and as it is serving another it is regarded as the knowablc of the Seer. If a conception is formed of that *{i.e,* Purusa), which is distinct from experience and nothing but absolute consciousnessj and Sarnyama is practised on that, then is knowledge regarding Purusa acquired. Purusa is not, however, realised by this intellectual conception of Him. Moreover, Purusa is the knower of the conception formed of Him, It has therefore been said in the Upanisad, 'What will the kuower be known by'.

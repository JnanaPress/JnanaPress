## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATANJALI

the mind arising out of words or expressions indicative of nothingness is vague notion relating to nihility. For example, "Purusa is devoid of the property of being created." Voidness is an unreality ; by it the nature of no existing matter can be predicated ; that is why the modification of the mind caused by such expression has no real background. As long as we go on thinking with the help of words, so long will Vikalpa or vague cognition continue.

The word 'Vikalpa' has various meanings ; for example, (i) as explained above, modification caused by verbal delusion or vague cognition, (ii) in the sense of va, i.e. 'or' as in Isvara-Pranidhanad-va' in Sütra 1.23, (iii) manifested world, as in Vedantic 'Nirvikalpa Samadhi', (iv) imposition of an imaginary concept as in the case of the image of 'I' in "I-sense".

(2) The phrase 'Chaitanya is the nature of the Purușa', although it has no significance in reality, conveys an impression to the mind through the usage of the words used as in the phrase "Chaitra's cow', the modification of the mind being caused by the subject and the predicate. Because it is a little difficult to understand, the commentator has given several examples of Vikalpa-Vrtti. In fact, it is not possible to follow the significance of Nirvitarka and Nirvichara Samadhi unless Vikalpa-Vrtti is understood clearly. Viparyaya or false cognition has no usefulness but Vikalpa or vague notion always serves a purpose.

the manifest Intellect etc. When for want of contact, there is no overseeing, the sequence of unevenness as manifestation in the shape of Intellect ceases or overseeing ends. Then for want of Intellect (or cognition) spiritual outlook also terminates and the three Gunas and their mutable nature are no longer overseen by Purusa.

'Overseeing the uneven mutation' means seeing the preponde. rance of manifestation. In other words, preponderance of Sattva Guna is knowledge or cognition, preponderance of Rajas is effort or conation, and preponderance of Tamas is retention. Thus through overseeing of Praktti or Pradhana, i.e. the three Gunas by Purusa, the evolution of Intellect etc. takes place.

(3) Incidentally the commentator has spoken of the characteristics of the mind. The patent characteristics are cognition or knowledge and conation or tendency or effort ; the latent characteristic is retention. Of the characteristics making up conation some are seen and some are unseen. The commentator has divided the unseen characteristics into seven classes as noted in the next paragraph. These unseen characteristics are of the nature of a thing, i.e. they are inferred as existing, but how they exist cannot be clearly comprehended. That which exists is an object or a reality.

Nirodha or Closed State = complete stoppage of mutation.

Dharma or Characteristic = Impressions of religious or irreligious actions with their threefold reactions.

Samskara here implies Vasana or latent impressions of the result of action and feelings retained in memory.

Parinama or Change = The imperceptible sequence according to which the mind is mutating.

Jivana or Life=the functions of the Pranas or the vital energies. They are the unseen actions of the Tamas force.

Chesta or Effort = The unseen action of mind which leads the senses to work.

Sakti or Power = The subtle force behind manifest action and effort.

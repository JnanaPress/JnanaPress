## By Siray^nia On The Kdltiodship Between Abasa And The Power Of Hearing, Divine Sense Of Hearing <sup>T</sup><sup>k</sup> Gained. 41.

All powers of hearing and all sounds abide in Akasa. It has thus been said that fAs the sense of hearing of all has a bearing on the identical sound element so it is related to that single clement' (l)r It is that conditioned hearing which is the **Einga** or token of Akasa\* arid absence of obstruction (void) is also mentioned as its Lihga or token. Moreover\* it is found that a formless tiling or a thing intangible\* is not limited by anything (as it can stay anywhere) | thus the **all-pervasiveness** oT Akasa is established. From the perception of sound it is inferred that the organ of hearing exists, for of two one who is deaf does not take in sound, wrhile who is not deal" takes it in. Hence it is the organ of hearing only of which the **sound** is the object. The yogin who practises Sarhyama on the relationship between the organ of hearing and the Akiisa\* develops subtle sense ol hearing.

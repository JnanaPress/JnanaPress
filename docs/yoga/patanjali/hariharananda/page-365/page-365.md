## SUPERNORMAL POWERS

On one side of that knowledge is the absolutely conscious Purusa devoid of any objectivity and on the other side is the sense of experience which is working on behalf of another (i.e. Purusa). The one in the middle, therefore, is that which is the object of Samyama. Thus the knowledge that is derived from this Samyama is the highest knowledge relating to Purusa. Thereafter on the cessation of the Intellect the Self becomes selfestablished and reaches the state of isolation.

Purusa cannot be objectively realised by Buddhi or Intellect. Then what is this knowledge of Purusa ? In reply the commentator states that the Intellect (being divested of all other knowables) which is shaped after the Purusa, when overseen by Him, is knowledge of Purusa.

Purusa by itself cannot be the object of Samyama but the pseudo-Purusa or the pure 41-sense, the 'I' regarding itself as the seer, is the subject of Samyama.

From Pratibha, a prescience is acquired of the knowledge of the subtle, the obstructed, the remote, the past and the future. From Śrāvaņa, divine sounds become audible ; from Vedana, the divine sense of touch is felt ; from Adarsa, comes the divine sense of light ; from Asvada, comes the cognition of divine taste, and by smell, the

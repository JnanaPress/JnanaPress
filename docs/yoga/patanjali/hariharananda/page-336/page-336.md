## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATAÑJALI

तेषां शब्दाय प्रत्ययानां प्रविभागः, तदृ यथा श्रवेतते प्रासाद द्वति क्रियार्थः, श्वेत: प्रासाद इति कारकार्यः शृष्टः । कियाकारकात्मा तद्यः प्रत्ययश्य, कस्मात्, सोऽयमित्यभिसन्दन्यादेकाकार एव प्रत्यय: संकेते इति । यस्तु श्वेतोऽर्थः स शब्दप्रत्ययोगालंबनीभूतः, स हि स्वाभिरवस्थाभिविकियमाणो न शब्द्स्स्हगतो न वुद्धिसहगत: । एवं शब्द एवं प्रत्ययो नेतरेतरसम्मूगत द्वति । धन्यथा शुष्टो-जन्यथायोऽन्यथा प्रत्यय द्रति विभाग:. एवं तत्प्रविभागसंयमाद्योगिनस्सवसत-ज्ञानं सम्पद्यत द्रति ॥ १७ ॥

Word, Object Implied And The Idea Thereof Overlapping, Produce One Unified Impression. If Samyama is Practised On Each Separately, Knowledge of the Meaning Of The Sounds Produced By All Beings Can Be Acquired (1). 17.

With regard to these (word, implied object and its knowledge) (2) articulation relates only to the alphabets constituting the word (A). Hearing relates to the sound thereof (B). It is a mental process that seizes the sounds of the alphabets and binds them together relating to one idea (C). Sounds of alphabets being pronounced successively and not being present at the same time, do not form a word but simply appear and disappear. Individually letter-sounds (alphabets) lack the nature of a word (D). Each letter is the constituent part of a word and is pregnant with the possibility of expressing innumerable ideas on association with others taking innumerable forms (E). A preceding letter is connected with the subsequent one, and vice versa, in a particular relationship to imply a particular word. Thus a group of alphabets following in a sequence (F) is assigned by conventional usage to indicate various objects. For example, in the word Gauh (= Cow), the G, Au, and H used together indicates a species of animal with particular features.

Thus regulated by their import, the sounds of the alphabets pronounced one after another, are presented

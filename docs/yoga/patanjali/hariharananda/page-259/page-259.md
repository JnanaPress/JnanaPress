## **They {The Restraints), However, [Become Ai Great Vow When They Become Universal, Being Unrestricted By Class, Place, Period Or Notion Of Duty fl)T 31.**

The example of harmlewneAs restricted by class is the case of' fisherman's harmlcssncss to all except to fish. Harmlessness distinguished by place is practising nonkilling only in holy places but not elsewhere, while that by period is observance of non-killing on a particular sacred clay. Harmlessness though no so limited might be restricted by idea of duty, *e.g.* observance of sacrifice or animals only to propitiate deities or Tor feeding of Brahmins and not for any other purpose. Another instance is of' Ksatriyas (fighting class) committing violence in war as a matter of duty, and practising h&rmlcsaness at other times. Thus \*thc restraints, harmlessness, truth etc. should be observed universally irrespective of class, place, period or customary duty. When they are observed in every instance, on all subjects without fail in any wav and thereby attain universality they arc called Great Vows.

{]) Every devotee practises some form or another of harmk'ssness eLc. but yogius practise them fully. Hliici. in their case they are universal and called Great Vows,

Notion of rule of duty = fighting being the duty of a K^ntnya, Arjuua had to fight. That is violence due to the notion of customary duty. Yogins, however, practise liarmlessness everywhere arid always.

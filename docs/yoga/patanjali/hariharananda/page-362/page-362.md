## **(By Practiaiog Samyania) On The Heart, Knowledge Of The Mind is Acquired. 34.**

**Thc citadel of Brahma (the heart), shaped like a lotus with a small aperture in it, is the scat of knowledge\* By Samyama on this, perception of the Ghitta arises (1).**

U) The word 'Samvit\* used in the Sfitra implies internal knowledge. By practising Saiiiyamn on the heart the fluctuations of the Chitta, which arc but mutations of the Buddhi or intellect, ;ire known correctly\* In the comments on Sutras I\*2fi and 111-35^, the heart and meditation therein have been dealt with\* In reality\* brain is the mechanism for knowledge, but for getting to the T-sense meditation on the heart is tFie easier method\* By <sup>w</sup>t[itching the action of the mind from the heart, the different fluctuations of the mind can be realised\* The fluctuations arc not spatial like light, sound etc\* The realisation of mental fluctuations is in fact the realisation of the flow of activity that exists in the knowledge of light, sound etc. The main root of knowledge ■is the intellectual conception of the T-feeling. That is realised through meditation on the heart\* and is only a step towards the knowledge about Puru\$a, mentioned hereafter.

## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATANJALI

the form of cessation or disappearance from view, which does not and cannot affect the Seer. This point has been dealt with in II-20 (2) ante. Isolation of the Purusa is the correct expression while liberation of Purusa is an ascribed expression.

## भाष्यम् - घ्यथ हानस्य कः प्राप्त्युपाय द्रति-विवेकख्यातिरविप्रवा हानोपाय: ॥ २६ ॥

सन्द्रपुर्वान्यताप्रत्ययो विवेकख्याति:, सा त्वनिवृत्तमिथ्याज्ञाना प्रवते। यदा मिथ्याज्ञानं द्र्यवीजभावं वन्ध्यप्रसवं संपद्यते तदा विधुतको श्रजसः संचस्य परे वैशारदेश परस्यां वशोकारसंज्ञायां वत्तमानस्य विविकप्रत्यय-प्रवास्तो निम्न्सलो भवति । सा विवेकख्यातिरविप्रवा हानस्योपाय:, ततो मिथ्यान्नानस्य द्रश्ववीज-भावोपगस: पुनयाप्रसव: । इत्येष मोच्चस्य मार्गों हानस्योपाय द्रति ॥ २६ ॥

What then is the means of escape ?

## Clear And Distinct (Unimpaired) Discriminative Discernment Is The Means Of Escape. 26.

The knowledge of distinction between Buddhi and Purusa is discriminative discernment, which is put out of use by undestroyed nescience (1). When wrong knowledge reaches the state of a burnt seed and ceases to be productive, then through the attainment of purity of Buddhi on account of removal of impurities due to afflictions, the yogin reaches the highest stage of the renunciation known as Vasikara-sanjna and the flow of his conception of discrimination becomes clear. That unimpaired discriminative knowledge is the means of escape. From that (discriminative discernment) follows the parched seed state of nescience and cessation of its productivity. This is the way to Moksa or means of escape.

(1) Discrimination has been explained before. It means distinction between Purusa and Buddhi. The established intense knowledge or conception or clear idea thereof, is discriminative discernment.

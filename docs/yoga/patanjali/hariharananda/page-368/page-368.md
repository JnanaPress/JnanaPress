## **By Conquering The Vital Force Called UdinA The Chaney Of Immersion In Water Or Mud, Or Entanglement In the Thoins la Avoided And Exit From The Body At Will Is Assured.** *39.*

Action of the senses characterised by the vital forces, is life. Its action is fivefold\* Priina moves about the mouth and the nose and its action extends up to the heart\* Sumana distributes (the properties of food) to all parts equally and its sphere of action is up to the navel. Apana is so called because it carries away and it acts down to the soles of the feet\* For carrying upwards, one vital force is called Udana. That goes right up to the head. The vital force Vyana is spread all over the body. Of these forces, the chief is the Prana. By being able to control completely the vital force of Udana the chance of immersion in water or mud is eliminated and at the time of death the exit {through the Archi and similar passages) is assured. On account of mastery over Udana the exit from the body (death) takes place at will (1)\*

(1) The vital force called Ud&tiei supports tilt nerve wherein feeling of the bodily humours, resides. All feelings are carried by the sense channels upward to the brain. By practising Saihyama on this upward flow and meditating on the presence of the sentient Sattwa China ID all the humours of the body, the body is felt to be light;. If the Chitta is fixed on the Udana in the Snsmutj<sup>3</sup> nerve it will facilitate the voluntary exit through the Archi and similar other passages.

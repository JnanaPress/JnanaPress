## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATAÑJALI

(1) Reference has been made before to Karma with its three types of fruition. When Karmasaya matures and brings forth birth, its result is the length of life and experience in the shape of enjoyment or suffering which continues throughout life. In this period, however, all the Karmas do not fructify all at once. They become ready to bear fruit according to their nature. That which has started action is said to be fructifying or Sopakrama and that which is inactive now but will give result at some future time, is called slow in fruition or Nirupakrama. Take, for instance, the case of a man who on account of action in a previous birth will suffer severely at the age of 40 which will close his span of life in another 3 years. For 40 years that Karma is said to remain as slow in fruition.

By perceiving the three-pronged latent impressions and the fast and slow fructifying Karmas amongst them, the particulars of their result will also be known. By that the Yogin will also come to know the time of the cessation of life. The commentator lias explained by illustration that those Karmas which are restrained from manifestation by obstacles are slow, and which are not so restricted are fast in fruition. Portents also indicate approaching death.

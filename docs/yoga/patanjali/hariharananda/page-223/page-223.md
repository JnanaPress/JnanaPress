The expression Absolute knower' means unconditioned apperception (1}\* This Purusa (Seer) is the reflector of Buddhi. He is neither similar nor dissimilar to Buddhi. Not similar, because an object of knowledge can be known or unknown *%o* Buddhi ; therefore Buddhi is mutative. The objects of knowledge, like cow (animate), pot (inanimate) though existing separately get known by colouring the Buddhi and become unknown when not so colouring. This character of knowing some objects and not knowing others indicates the mutative nature of Buddhi\* While the fact that Purusa is never unknown illustrates his non-mutativeness, because Buddhi overseen by the Purusa cannot be sometimes apprehending and sometimes non-apprehending, he. it is always apprehending. Thus the everprcsence of the awareness of Purusa is established, and the immutability oi Purusa is also proved (2).

Moreover, Buddhi is not an end ii: itself as it acts in co-operation with others, while Purusa is not a means to an end (3). Furthermore, as Buddhi is the Facility ol generating assured cognition oT all objects, it is composed of the three Gutias and is thus really unconscious. Plij usa is the Overseer of the Gupas (4). For these reasons Pumsa is not similar to Buddhi. Is He then dissimilar ? No, not entirely dissimilar (5\ because though pure, modification^ are overseen by Purusa, as He oversees the ideas formed in Buddhi. By such

Samrullii Fret- from the touch of words, a collection of its Intent impressions fills the mind and this is called Nirvitarka SmnApatti- Thus the state of collection of impressions miring concentration is Nirvitarkl and their retention in the mind â– with the help ol words is SavilarkA\*

liven when words are uttered, it might he Nirvitarka or Hiivicli&ra Dliya.ua (meditation) free from Vikalpa\* as for example when the meaning of the words is not noticed but the words are uttered mechanically and conceived as sound **only.** Or, when the object noticed is only the effort made in littering the word, it can be DEiyAua (meditation) of a knowable object without atiy Vikalpa. If, however, the knowledge of tin.- effort is **Only** aimed at the cogniser or the instruments of cognition, then, even when uttering words\* it will be meditation without any Vitalp;u

(4) The subject of Nirvitarkft Sam&pattij r.r\* the knowledge of the gross object on which Nirvitarltn Samttpatti is practised is the highest truth in respect of that object\* No gross object can be cognised better, because then alE the senses are at rest and there is no infiltration of words and ideas.

'Cognition of afi object as a single unit1 means that the object is cognised as one. Although an object is the *sum* total of many **components** yet it is conceived as one\* 'Separate entity' indicates that it is recognised as having a separate existence of its own, "Assemblage or collection of particular a Loin s' implies that otic object has a distinctive conglomeration of atoms\* which can only be discovered by Nirvitarlcft concentration\*

to) "Assemblage' a particular combination of the constituent atoms peculiar lo the object. I'or example a pot is nothing more than the assemblage of particular atoms or monads of sound, coIout, etc, comprising it and it follows those atoms, i.i. the properties that are present in the atoms are **present** in **tile** pot itself.

Therefore the substance 'pot' can be characterised as one, big or small\* of tactile property\* an object of the senses, active, *i.t.* liable to mutation, therefore not perpetual, *irt.* liable to appearance or disappearance\* All gross objects characterised

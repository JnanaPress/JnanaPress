## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATANJALI

said, "There is no austerity superior to Praņāyāma ; it removes impurities and makes the light of knowledge shine.

(1) Pranayama which causes the decay of the veil which covers discriminative knowledge is not the veil of ignorance, but the veil of Karma or actions based on ignorance. Karma is the means of sustenance of ignorance. Therefore attenuation of Karma attenuates ignorance as well. Praņāyāma is actionlessness of the body and the senses. By that the latency of activities based on the Klesas (afflictions) gets attenuated just as the latency of anger is attenuated by non-anger. Thus it is clear that Pranayama weakens and causes the decay of the false knowledge based on Avidya, viz. the idea that the body or the sense is the self, and so also with the corresponding actions and latencies. Some people raise the objection that ignorance being destroyable only by knowledge, how can (physical) act in the form of Pranayama cause its destruction ? In reply to it, it may be said that in this case also, ignorance is destroyed by knowledge. Praņāyāma is no doubt a physical act but the knowledge gained by the act causes destruction of ignorance. The process of Pranayama, separates the 'I-sense from the body and the sense-organs. Therefore the corresponding knowledge of the act (every act has its corresponding knowledge) is "I am neither the body nor the senses".

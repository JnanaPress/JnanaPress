## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATANJALI

others it becomes feeble, then by a process of elimination, a spirit of renunciation can be maintained partially, that is known as Vyatireka abnegation. When by practice that is mastered, when the sense-organs are completely weaned away from objects and the spirit of attachment remains only in the mind, then it is called Ekendriya. 'Ekendriya' means that which resides in one sense-organ-here, the mind. Later when the adept Yogin has no longer to control his spirit of attachment, when naturally his mind and his sense remain aloof from worldly objects and even from supermundane matters, then that is called the state of Vastkara which is Vairagya or complete detachment. That is a state of absolute indifference to the things of the world.

## Indifference To The Gunas Or The Constituent Principles Achieved Through A Knowledge Of The Nature Of The Purusa Is Called Paravairagya (Extreme Detachment). 16.

Through the practice of the effort to realise the Purusa-principle, the Yogin having seen the faulty nature of all objects visible or described in the scriptures, gets a clarity of vision and steadiness in Sattvika qualities. Such a Yogin edified with a discriminative knowledge (1) and with sharpened and chastened intellect becomes indifferent (2) to all manifest and unmanifested states of the three Gunas or constituent principles (3). There are thus two kinds of detachment.

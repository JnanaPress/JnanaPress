## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATANJALI

वोतरागविषयं वा चित्तम् ॥ ३७ ॥

भाष्यम्-वौतरागचित्तालब्बनोपरक्षः वा योगिनश्चित्तं स्थितिपदं लभत दूति ॥ ३७ ॥

## Or (Contemplating) On A Mind Which Is Free From Desires (The Devotee's Mind Gets Fixed). 37.

If a Yogin meditates on the mind of a passionless person he also attains stability of mind (1).

(1) A mind full of passion or desires finds it easy to think of objects but finds it difficult to get into a carefree selfcentred state, whereas a mind free from passion finds it easy to be unattached and free. Fully realising what that state is, if the mind is set thinking on that, and that habit is assiduously cultivated then the mind gradually gets steady.

If contact is established with a desireless saint, his carefree, non-desiring mien will give an idea of what the attitude of desirelessness is. Further, imagining the desireless mind of Hiranyagarbha and others, if one's mind is fixed on its contemplation then the result will be the same.

If one's own mind can be freed of desires, and thus free from thought, and if that state of the mind can be mastered by practice, then the mind can also become free from attachment to objects. This is really practising detachment.

## ख्वप्रनिटाजानानाम्बनं वा । ३८ ॥

भाष्यम्-स्वप्रज्ञानालम्बन विद्राज्ञानालबन्दनं वा तटाकारं योगिनाशित्तं स्थितिपद नभत द्वति ।। ३८ ॥

Or By Taking As The Object Of Meditation The Images Of Dreams Or The State Of Dreamless Sleep (The Mind Of The Yogin Gets Stabilised). 38.

The Yogin who adopts for purposes of contemplation the images of dreams or the state of dreamless sleep can also get stability of mind (1).

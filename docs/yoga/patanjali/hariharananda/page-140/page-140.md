## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATAÑJALI

towards the practice of meditation, developing intense insight in these three ways, perfect Yoga or seedless or objectless concentration is acquired. (1).

1. The Sruti i.e. the Upanisads also say that realisation comes through listening, meditating and concentrating. If one learns by listening only that Atman (the Self) is different from Buddhi (Individual 'I-feeling'), or that the principles or realities are such and such or that this sort of state is Moksa (cessation of sorrow), he really does not get to know much. Similarly, if by inference only one gets to know about the Purusa and other principles, there is no chance of bringing about cessation of sorrow thereby. But if one constantly thinks of or meditates on such matters as 'I am not the body', 'External things are sorrowful and therefore should be forsaken', 'I shall not resolve on worldly affairs', etc., then will real practice of the means to liberation begin. If one gets to know by argument only that he is not the body and yet gets moved by its distress or pleasure, then there would be no difference between him and ignorant man.

There cannot be any better knowledge of an object than what can be acquired by Nirvichara Samadhi. That is why it is complete truth. Rta means realised i.e. perfect truth.

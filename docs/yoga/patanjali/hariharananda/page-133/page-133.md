## **ON CONCENTRATION IM**

CENTRAL LIBRARY

**sort of verbal reflection colours the knowledge acquired in Savichara or reflective concentration. And when the knowledge derived from it is free from reflective consciousness and is only of the subject of engrossment it is Nirvichara. Of all the Samapattis^ chose relating to gross (3) objects is either Savitarka or Nirvitarka and those relating to subtler objects are Savichara or Nirvichara. This is how by establishing the freedom of Nirvitarka from Vikalpa such freedom of both itself and Nirvichara is explained\***

(l) What is Savichara has been explained before (I'41). What the commentator lias said is being explained here. "Of manifested properties1' means the properties which are evident in the shape of pot, picture, trf\* not uiimanifest as being past, rheffifote, to practise engrossment is the subtler elements\* a manifest object has to be adopted.

Space, time and causation :—If the manifest form of an object is adopted foT the purpose of realising; its constituent subtler elements, the space occupied by the object **will** come within the range of the hnowables aud the realisation of the TtniruStras in them will be limited by that space. This knowledge will however only relate to its present properties, *i.e\** will not bring any knowledge relating to what it wes or what it might be front the constituent TanmJitra?.

Causation is that property the adoption of which reveals the nature of the particular Tauin&tra. In other words, the process of arriving at *the* perception of a particular **Tamn&tra** by reflecting **On** *<sup>A</sup>* particular property of an object is arriving at through the principle of causation\*

In Savichara Samadhi or reflective concentration, the ubjeet is cognised *aam* a single unit, *\.€.* as regarded as without any admixture. The knowledge acquired in Savicbflra Saunipatti is influenced by the verbal idea about the object witli the help of which reflection is conducted\* fly that sort of reasoning with language, knowledge is gained of different kinds but of the present existence only of subtler elements.

**retention, or feeling, willing and memory. These primary characteristics change put do not disappear altogether.**

**From these it would appear that what can be cognised in some form or another is called <sup>a</sup> characteristic. Of the cognisable properties that which** *i***<sup>s</sup> directly known is called the emergent or present, what was Cognised before is quiescent or past, and which is considered fit to be known later is called Human ifested or future.**

**What is present is known directly, and what <sup>a</sup> to past and future arc conjectured as they are not manifest- The past and the future characteristics of an object may be innumerable because there is :\* fundamental unity of all objects ? hence all objects might change into anything else.**

**This is the outlook of the Sruiikhya philosophy and its basic method of analysis. In its view causes are divisible into two—efficient and material. The changed condition of an object through a cause is the effect.**

**[2) Manifestation of a thing is dependent on space, time, shape and cause. 1C verything can be made of everything but that does not mean that it Can so happen without any cause. Ksamples of dependence on space are—a thing very close to the eye Cannot be seen properly, bnL it can be seen at a comparatively distant place : things arc thought of as small or large on account of location at a distance or otherwise ; of dependence on time, the examples are—a child docs not get oh! at once, but gradually, two ideas do not occur at the same lime but one after another ; of dependence on shape, instances are a square die cannot give a round impression, a man is not bom of <sup>a</sup> deer. Efficient cause is the real cause. Space, time etc. arc only practical variations of the efficient cause- Every cause, Other than the material, is the efficient cause. With appropriate efficient cause\* unmauifested characteristics become manifest.**

**The commentator Is as explained here that the thing which we use as the aggregate of particular, or visible or emergent characteristic, and djnjcctumble, he- general (not particular) or past and future characteristics, i-s the substratum.**

**When we see a characteristic we must understand that thesis behind it a basic substratum which is an aggregate of all**

The fear that arises oat of the hurt to that stupified feeling; or threat of injury to it is Abhinivcsa-Klesa. It causes Affliction in the shape of fear.

**Although** the Self is really **immortal,** this fear of death, born of ignorance! is the chief AbhiniveÂ£a-Kle^a, the affliction caused by the fear of extinction. The Commentator has shown how a previous life can be inferred from that. Other fears are also Abhinive5a-Klcsa. This Abhinivesa is an affliction, a feeling inimical to spiritual practice. There are also other meanings of Abhiniveia.

(2) There can be remembrance only of things felt before\* When anything is felt, it is stored in the mind. Its recollection is memory. Memory of the fear of death is found in all creatures. Death has tiot been experienced in this life. Therefore it must be conchided that it was experienced in a previous life, In this way, the reality *ot &* previous life is established from Abhinivesa,

It might be urged that as fear of death is natural there is no need of a previous experience therein. If recollection of death is called natural, then every memory may be said to be natural. But mcinOjy is not natural ; it arises from some cause, and past experience is that cause. When recollections always arise out of a causCj then one class of it (fear of death etc,} cannot reasonably be called natural. A natural thing does not arise out of a cause\* A natural characteristic never leaves Xhe thing to which it belongs. Fear of death is found to cease with acquisition of knowledge. Therefore acquisition of ignorance (repeated experience of fear of death through ignorance) must be its cause. In this way from a persons fear of death and allied distresses its previous experience and thus previous birth, is established.

Again, the question might be asked Svhat is the proof that fear of death is a form of remembrance ?+ In reply, it may be said \*tliat memory is the perception of something iuternal without coming into contact with any external object. Remembrance arises from some form of idea analogous to it\* Feat of death also arises within tlie mind through a similar process, that is why it is a form of memory.

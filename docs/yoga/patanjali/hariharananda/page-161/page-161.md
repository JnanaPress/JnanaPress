## ON PRACTICE

after or greed for a thing is that state which brings about a longing to obtain it. In greed the sense of good and evil is generally benumbed. The word Anusayee or 'following' implies that it exists as a latency in the mind. In attachment, desire is brought involuntarily and unconsciously towards the senses and objects, and the power to consciously restrain desire disappears. That is why attachment is regarded as a kind of ignorance or misapprehension. By this the self gets mixed up with the senses and objects. In this instance, it is misapprehension to take the detached self as related to the latencies of pleasure pertaining to the senses which are not parts of the self. Besides this, to regard evil as good is also a characteristic of attachment.

## Aversion Is That (Modification) Which Follows Misery. 8.

Aversion is the feeling of resistance, mental disinclination, propensity to hurt and anger towards misery or objects producing misery, arising out of a recollection of the misery by one who has experienced it before.

Pratigha = Desire to retaliate, or to resist. To one who has no aversion there is nothing to oppose but to one who has aversion, opposition comes at every step. Manyu = Malice, Jighansa (lit. desire to kill) = Vindictiveness.

As in attachment, so in aversion the non-selfish latencies of misery are identified with the Self and the inactive Self is considered as the doer. This is also false cognition.

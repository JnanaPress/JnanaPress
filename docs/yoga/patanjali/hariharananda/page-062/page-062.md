That which flows down the plane of Viveka or discriminative knowledge ending in the plateau of Kaivatya or Isolation, leads unto good ; while that which flows up to the plateau of rc-birth down the plane of non-discrimination leads unto evil\* Among these, the flow towards sense-objects is thinned by renunciation, and development of a habit of discrimination opens the floodgate of discriminative knowledge.

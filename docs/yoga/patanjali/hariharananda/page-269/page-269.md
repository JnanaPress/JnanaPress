(1) Invincible powers means unopposed or nilobstructed knowledge, nctiou and power like the power of minifacation or reducing oneself to a small particle- Incontinence deprives the nerves etc, of vital powers. Practice of continence prevents loss of vitality and increases power, thereby gradually leads to accumulation of invincible powers. When this becomes established the power to impress knowledge to the disciple is acquired. The words of wisdom of an incontinent person do not go deep into the mind of a disciple but they only touch the surface.

Only abstaining from sensual acts while indulging in food and sleep, does not lead to being established in continence-Unless the natural production of the body-seed is checked by firmness of thought, control of food and sleep, and abandonment of desire for Corresponding objects, continence cannot be achieved.

Of these—

Mindication (Ariima), thaL by which one can reduce one's size to that of an atom. Lightness (Laghima)\* that by which one can decrease one's weight. Largeness (Mahima), that by which one can increase one's size or stature. Attaining (Prapti), that by which one can touch the moon by fingertips. Irresistible will (Prakamya), that by which one can go through solid earth or cannot be immersed in water. Control (Vasitva), that by which one can have control over the Bhiitas and which they arc made of\* *i.e.* Tanmatras, and cannot be swayed by others. Mastery (IsiLrtva), that by which one can control appearance, disappearance and aggregation of Bhutas and objects made thereof. Resolution (Vatrakamavasaitva)\* that by which one can determine at will the Bhutas and their nature and their stayings as desired.

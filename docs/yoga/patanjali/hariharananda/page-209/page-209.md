**this is deter mi nation. The thought process may be analyser! into these six steps, b'or example, the mind accepts many presentations like blue, yellow\* sweet, .sour etc. <sup>J</sup> lien they are retained in the mind. Subsequently in retrospection they are remembered\* when by elimination of the particular features generalities are conceived. Thus, light element is the common generalised factor of all coloursâ€”**blue\* **yellow, etc, which arc its specific forms. Light clement is therefore an essence or concept and its knowledge is conception or the knowledge of essence. With the rise of the knowledge of the essential uattire in this way, the decision that it is acceptable or otherwise is called Determination or Abhinivesa. This is an example of the knowledge about elements <sup>7</sup> the ordinary knowledge of pots\* cloths, etc. also follows this process [see I-6(i)j.**

**They are present in all forms of fluctuating mind including the one-pointed, while ill minds where fluctuations have stopped\* they have stopped also. In all objects, worldly or spiritual, there are reception, retention etc. Reception is direct perception, retention is obscured reception, while effort to recall, selection from recalled things, conception on selected things and determining action thereon, are all retrospections. The knowledge of principles involving no reasoning is simple reception.**

**These processes are characteristics of the mind. When Bliddhi is impure, reception occurs but does** <sup>110</sup>**<sup>I</sup> discriminate between the Urartu (Seer) and D^ya (seen or knpwable). This is Avidy**3 01 **nescience, while the mind is enlightened the knowledge of the difference between the two becomes clear ; and this is Vidvtt or correct knowledge. Thus reception is only attributed** *to* **the Seer though it actually remains in Huddhi. PUTUSR is only the experiencer of th\*j result of reception or a Seer of what is happening in the mind.**

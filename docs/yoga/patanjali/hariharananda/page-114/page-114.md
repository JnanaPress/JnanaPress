Unless such contemplation is practiced continuously for a day or two, its effects are not realised. Practising this for some time **gradually** and arriving at a stage when there is no interruption by thought, or any hindrance, if it is tried in <sup>A</sup> state of fasting or on meagre diet by holding the mind concentrated on the tip of the nose, etc\*, then the higher senseperception is developed\* That this sort of realisation induces deep faith in Yoga and *<sup>a</sup>* renunciation of **earLhly** sounds, etc. has been explained by the commentator.

then it involves only experience or experience ami span. Therefore KArm&£ay& which is operative in the same life brings about either one or two results.

H. Kanu&saya is mainly of one birth but Yasana [Matrix latency—see 11-15 (I)]—is of many births\* The three consequences experienced in the chain of births coming down from eternity, have produced latency in the shape of Vasa <sup>n</sup> as\* which are thus eternal i,r. of various births.

L Karm&sayas are of two kinds—that relating to Karinas which must mature and that relating to Katinas which may not. Those which must produce results are called Niyata\*vip&kar while those which being influenced by others cannot produce complete results are called Amyata-viplka.

J\* The rule about Uni-genital birth (life) is the general rule\* but there are exceptions,

K. In respect of Niyata-vipflka Karmisayas which are operative in that birth, the rule being operative in one life, holds good Fully\* They arc fully gathered in that life. Therefore they are Jikabhavika.

L\* Iti respect of Aniynta-vipaka Karm^sayas which are to bear fruit in some future life, that rule does riot apply\* for there are three courses which such Karinas may take :—

*{&)* The ua fructified Karma, may be destroyed virtue is destroyed by vice and vice-versa\* The vicious Karmlsaya born of latency of sin arising out ofauger, is destroyed by the habit born of constant practice of non-auger. Therefore it cannot be said that the rule that when a Karma is done its result must be borne, is not without exception. Unless it is destroyed by a contrary action or by propeT insight, Karma inevitably bears fruit\*

As the Karmasaya gathered **in One** life can **be destroyed** to some extent, the uni-genital rule **does** not \*fully apply to KarniSssiya which is due to be operative in some future life.

(b) When a minor K&Tin&iaya matures with a chief Karmlsaya it is manifested feebly ; hence the rule that H would fructify in the following birth\* does not apply iti this ca.se.

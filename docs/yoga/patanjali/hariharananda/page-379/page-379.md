## SUPERNORMAL POWERS

By its property of being an object of experience, it causes happiness or misery and the body that experiences both, while by renouncing both it leads to salvation.

(3) By practising Samyama on the most recent, i.e. the last formed shape, in which all the five forms are present (which are not present in the Tanmatras) the five forms have to be gradually realised and conquered and thus power acquired over them. With the acquisition of such power comes the knowledge of all their particulars and the ability of changing them at will. With the conquest of the essential character the principles underlying properties like hardness etc., become known and the power to change them at will is acquired.

With the conquest of the subtle form, wiz. the Tanmatras, the essence of the real nature of properties like sound etc., comes to be known and those properties can be changed at will. In other words, with power over subtlety, the nature of sounds etc. can be changed.

With power over inherent form, the organs of senses, through which pleasure and pain are experienced and which are made of the Bhutas, can be influenced. On realisation of the objectcharacter the power to renounce the Bhutas from a spiritual standpoint, is acquired. By reaching a state beyond the touch of pleasure, pain or obsession caused by the Bhutas, a yogin can become completely indifferent to externals. This is how the Bhutas and their various natures are conquered. What owns an object may be called its cause or Praktti. The self which is the owner of such objects, mentioned in III-35, is this kind of Prakrti, but it is not the primal principle of nature called Prakrti, because it still forms part of the Intellect.

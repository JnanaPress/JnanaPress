## YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATAÑJALI

## That Practice When Continued Constantly For A Long Time Without Break And With Devotion Becomes Firm In Foundation. 14.

Continued for a long time and constantly indulged in a devoted way, i.e. with austerity, continence, learning and reverence, it is said to have been done with earnest attention and it gets firmly established.

It is said in the Chhandogya Upanisad, "That which is done with proper knowledge, with devotion and in conformity with the scriptures, i.e. done in the proper method, becomes more forceful".

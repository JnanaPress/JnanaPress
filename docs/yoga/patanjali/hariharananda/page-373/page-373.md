Moreover, that object will also be like a point of electricity. If the microscopic point of electricity can be regarded as having weight that will be the real weight of tbe body. Of course\* it is not our T-sen&e alone which is responsible for the weight of the body- Our T-seuse acting on the materials constituting the body reduces them into the form of a hotly. The real nature of the material of the body is like a particle of electricity or a state of vacancy like the Ak^a. If by some method the T-seoee is directed towards that relationship between the body and the Akiisa, tbe material of the body can be **shaped** accordingly. In other words, the particular movement of the atoms of the body which is known as weight can be changed to make it light, and this can be accomplished in that way. Thus the T-sense permeating the empty void to make it feel heavy constitutes the body. It is not impossible to change that T-fiCUse by contemplation. It has to be understood in this wa|. The body can also be made light by means other than that of Yoga.

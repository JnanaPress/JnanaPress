## **6 YOGA PHTLOSOPFfV OF PATaSJALI**

pointed state of mind reveals the real nature of things. That is why if the forces of habit arising out of fundamental human weaknesses are allayed and the spring of our actions is sapped through renunciation based on correct knowledge, such renunciation becomes everlasting. Therefore, in that state the KleÂ£as me attenuated, and the bonds created by the latent traces of previous actions are loosened.

Gradually with the elimination of feelings of attachment etc., actions which would have been dictated by such feelings cease altogether and thus the process leads on to a suppressed state of the mind. It should, however, be clearly **understood** that Samprajillta Yoga is not simply concentration. When

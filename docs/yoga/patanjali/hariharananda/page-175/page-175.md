Panchasikha, ''In **sacrificial** rites, along with the principal Karmasaya of virtue is also produced the Karmasaya of sin. In the principal Karmasaya of virtue that sin is small, mixed with virtue, and removable by atonement, (but if no atonement is done) it brings a touch *oi* suffering (as in the midst of profuse enjoyment a man feels the pangs of hunger ii he goes without food). Thai sin is, however, unable to reduce the Karmasaya of virtue, because (it might be said) I have many virtuous deeds to my credit, which will overwhelm the sinful Karmasayas and make them ineffective in causing distress in heaven/' How it remains dormant for a long time overpowered by the chief unrestricted Karmasayas is being explained here. Death has been said to be the general cause of manifestation of the unrestricted Karmasaya operative in future life ; but this rule does not always hold good, because death is not always the cause of complete manifestation of limited Karma operative in future **life.** Those Karmas which arc to be operative in a future liTc and whose fruition is not yet appointed, can be destroyed ; and they **may** get mixed up or stand overpowered and may not fructify for a long time, until similar actions competent to bring the cause of their manifestation into play incline them towards fruition. Because the time, the place and the cause of such manifestation are indeterminable, the course of Karma is regarded as mysterious and undiscermblo. But (in such a case) this being an exception the general rule is not broken\* Therefore, il has been held that Karmasaya isjmi-genital i.f. of one birth (life) only,

**(l) Fluctuations due to nescience are the general states** of **the manifested** mind. **When through knowledge, nescience** is **destroyed, the 'mt-mine**<sup>1</sup> feeling, **from which springs tin. identity of tile self with the body,** is **destroyed completely**

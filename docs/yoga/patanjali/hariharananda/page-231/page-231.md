as metaphor only and taking all their aspects\* a misconception lias arisen.

The word 'Artha' means object and not value. Puru^a is the kuower, Huddhi is the known or revealed. Ordinarily revealer means one who reveals. The **revealeT** is **the** agent of the action of revealing but this is a linguistic convention. When we say that the revealed is published by the publisher, it is implied that the publisher lias no activity\* Therefore m every Case the **revealer** is **not** the active agent. A<sup>d</sup> inactive thing is made to appear as active by the words used in describing it. We do **the same** thing in **Tegard** to the inactive Purina. On account of the presence of the self-ilium**dialing** Puru^a. behind lI'a such function of revealing as (1 am the **revealer** of Self **or** 'I am the **kuOweT of** self1 is done by *\*<sup>1</sup>\* Thus imagining tlie Primpa as the agent of **such** action we call him the revealer or illuininer. In reality the action of revealing is with the HIT-sense. Because that happens on ftCCOUDt of proximity of Purnya, Ht is said to be the revealer.

The affairs—experience and liberation or discrimination—are only forms of Bnddhi\* The three Guyas only do not make liuddhi but the mutated state of the three Gunas in contact with the unit Seer constitutes Hudclhi. Buddhi being an object, tlie entity by which it is revealed is called its owner or publisher. The form of expression used for expressing the idea is done for clarity of the idea, but it does not in any way make the real thing active. 'Object of the Puru^a1—this relative term does not therefore indicate any action on the part of the Puru^a.

If experience and liberation are objects or reveal <sup>a</sup> hie\* then by whom arc I hoy revealed and who will be the revealer ? The answer is Purusa, the Seer. To be thus an object of the Puru^a in the shape of experience or liberation is the real nature of the KuowfiLble,

His Yoga aphorisms deal with the mind and its fluctuations, showing the way how **they** can be controlled and how complete mastery over the mind can lead to cessation of misery and attainment of peace leading to salvation. The pithy maxims were amplified by Vyasa and This amplification has come to be regarded as an integral pan of the aphorisms to ensure correct understanding til the philosophy underlying them.

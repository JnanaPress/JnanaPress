## Through Destruction Of Impurities, Practice Of Austerities Brings About Perfection Of The Body And The Senses. 43.

When austerities are practised, the veil of impurity is removed. Then perfection of the body in the form of Anima (minification) etc. and perfection (Siddhi) of the senses, such as clairaudience, clairvoyance etc. develop (1).

(1) Austerities in the form of Pranayama etc. chiefly remove the impurity in the form of subjection to the limitations of the body. Removal of such subjection (i.e. not being affected by hunger and thirst) by standing and Yogic posture, or by breathing etc., leads to the removal of the enveloping impurities owing to them. Then, the mind, unaffected by bodily limitations, due to the unhindered growth of will-power can bring about perfections (Siddhis) of the body and the senses. Yogins, however, do not make use of Yogic austerities for the attainment of such forms of perfection (Siddhi) but they apply them for spiritual attainments.

## **Tht Subtle Kltsas Are Destroyed Or Fgraaken By The Cessation Of Productivity Or Disappearance (I) Of The Mind. 10.**

**Those five Klcsas become like parched seeds and disappear whh the mind of the yogin, which having fulfilled the purpose of its existence becomes defunct,**

In other words there cannot then arise any spontaneous T feeling regarding the body and the senses and thereby produce any distraction in the mind. This sort of parched state is the subtle form of Asmita-Klesa or the egoistic affliction.

Through fixity of the thought of renunciation its insight is acquired and attachment becomes thin or ineffective as a parched seed, So becomes aversion through insight based on nou-hatred ; and by the reduction of the thought of the body as self\* the fear of extinction is reduced\*

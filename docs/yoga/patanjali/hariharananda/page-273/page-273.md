## ON PRACTICE 251

CENTRAL LIBRARY

Austerities li Ice practice of sleeplessness, steadiness of posture, abstention from food, suspension of vital energy etc, are opposed to human nature and favourable to the nature of celestial beings, lieucc they bring about perfections (Siddhis) of the body aud the senses. That is why jBaosyogins, who devote themselves only to the practice of discrimination and dispnssioti, to the exclusion of such austerities, may not have these Siddhis\* When discrimination is perfected. SamAdhi also can be attained ; and if a Vqgin of that class so desires, he may attain the form of supernormal perfection called Vivekaja Siddhi (III. 5'i), but it is not likely for the Yogiu possessed of discrimination, to have this desire. That is why JuAuayogins may attain emancipation without attaining the powers of Siddhi of the body and ihc- senses fill. <sup>55</sup> 0)1 inÂ«a <sup>11</sup>

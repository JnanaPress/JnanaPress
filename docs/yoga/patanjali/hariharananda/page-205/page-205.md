of the nature of knowledge of sou ml, mobile state of the nature of vibration and inert state of the nature of potential energy of vibration are obtained. In respect of touch etc. three similar states are obtainable.

In respect of sense-organs like the organ of speech etc, also, the same three states are noticeable. By the organ of speech sound is transformed into different alphabets, which constitute activity giving rise to words. The three states of sentience, mobility and inertia are also there, lu objects where Tanias (riiiia predominates, t,\*. in retentive objects the same rule applies,

When instruments of reception are analysed, similar three states are found\* Take for instance the organ of hearing. Its property is to make the sound known. That property **is** its .sentient state. The nervous impulse which is excited by external vibration and other actions of the ear are the result of its mutative property. The energy stored in the nerves and muscles when activated is transformed into knowledge and this constitutes the retentive state of the ear\* Similarly, the tactile sense or muscular sense inhering in the motor organ of action constitutes the sentient aspect, the movement of the hand constitutes its mutative aspect while the energy **Underlying** the nerves and muscles constitutes the retentive aspect.

These are external sensc-orgaits. When the internal senseorgans are analysed they similarly reveal the three states of sentience, mutation and retention- Ju every mental modification one part is sentient, one mutative and the other retentive\*

**Thus we know** that everything external or internal is like mi aggregate of the three states of sentience, mutation and retention. Besides these, there is not nor can there be any other, fundamental material cause known. Thus Sattva, Rajas and Tanias are the three primal material causes of the world.

4 There is no action without energy or potentiality and no sensation without action, So sensation must be preceded by action and action by energy\* They are thus inseparably linked. If there is one, there must be the other **Lwo,** but the **property** which preponderates will give the name to the state. That

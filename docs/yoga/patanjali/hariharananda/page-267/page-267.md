Perverse thoughts like harm etc\* are known in their subtlest forms only through meditation and are removed from the mind through force of meditation\* Sublime meditation is the cause of establishment in restraints and observances-Many think that Y&m&s (restraints) have to be practised first, then Niyamas (observances)\* That is wrong\* Krom the very beginning Dbarayi (fixity) favourable to restraints, observances, postiiTe\* breath control and withholding of sense-organs has to be practised, OhflranR (fixity) When developed becomes Dhyatia (meditation) which later becomes SaniAdhi (concentration). Along with that restraints and observances get established and posture etc\* become perfect.

To be established in restraints and Observances means the non-productivity of perverse thoughts. When evil thoughts like harm do not appear in the mind l>y themselves, then alone hartnlessness etc\* can be said to be established.

When men and beasts can be brought under control through slight development of will-power by mesmerism, it cannot be doubted that yogius will be able to develop their will-power to such an extent that they will be able to banish harm from their nature, so much^ so that other beings coming near them will be influenced by their ideas and give up their cruel nature iu their presence-

## ON CONCENTRATION

(1) A-linga. That which terminates or merges into its cause. That by which anything is indicated is a token or Linga. That of which there is no cause or which has not merged in any other and which is not indicative of anything else is A-Linga. Pradhana or Prakrti is A-Linga.

(2) The elements of Ksiti, Ap etc. have two forms-(i) the aggregated gross state which is felt as various kinds of smell, sound, light etc. and (ii) the subtle state without any such variety e.g. smell monad, sound monad, or light monad etc. The Tanmatras are the minutest sensations of subtle objects received by the senses. The external cause of such perception is the Ego of the Great or Divine Mind known as Bhūtādi. Sensation of sound etc. are really modifications of the mind. The knowledge of Tanmatra is along the flow of time only because there is no perceptible space in it. When there is knowledge as a flow of time, there must be a perceptible activity of the mind. Therefore knowledge of Tanmatra is based on the action of internal senses i.e, the working of the dynamic ego. Thus dynamic ego or the variable "I-sense is the subtler form of Tanmatra which is really the minute part or unit of sensation. The flow of mutations or change of knowledge has to be adopted for contemplation to realise the dynamic ego. The subtler form of this dynamic ego is Mahattattva, or pure Asmita, or pure 'I-feeling'. The subtle form of Mahat is Pradhana or Prakrti.

(3) Purusa does not suffer any such change as Prakti does. The latter is changed into Mahat etc. But as Praktti does not suffer change unless overseen by Purușa, so Purușa is regarded as the instrumental or efficient cause of Mahat etc.

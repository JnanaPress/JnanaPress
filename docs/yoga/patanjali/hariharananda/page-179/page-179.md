Dominant or thief Karmliaya = that which is capable of bearing Ire it independently.

Minor Kiinn'daya = that which is late ill action or is there in a secondary position\*

The latency of Karma done under intense Itfet, auger, spirit of forgiveness, charity, etc\* is dominant KarmSsaya. ll is always ready to fructify\* Its opposite\* the minor Karimisaya, does not become operative independently ; it act\* as secondary to the chief Karmflsaya. The Karmisaya responsible for future births, is thus an aggregate of primary and secondary ones. The minor Karmasayas do not fructify completely ; so the rule that 'the result of all actions in this life will come about m the following life' is not fully applicable iu the case of minor ones.

(c) When a very strong or primary Karmftsaya hcar^ fruit, the opposite secondary one remains subdued\* It does not bear fruit at the time, but it can fructify at some future time if it is roused by' some kindred Karini,S9ya,

Jn this cast also the rule of fructification in the next birth, also does not apply, as the minor Kaunas of one life remain suppressed in.it. An example of this is as follows!â€” A man does pious deeds in his boyhood\* Then in his youth he does many beastly acts through greed. At the time of his death, the Fully mature latencies of \$iu form the appropriate Karmisayas\* As a result\* the life of a beast that he gets\* does not show the result of the pious actions done previously ; but Mich of the pious deeds as are enjoyable in a human lite, remain stored up, and they will become operative when he is again born as <sup>A</sup> man\* These will be Helpful when lie does pious acts in his subsequent human life. In this illustration the pious and vicious actions should be understood to be not mutually antagonistic. If they had been so, the vice would hftve killed the effect of the virtuous deeds\* Suppose, forgive\* is a virtue and stealing a vice. Larceny does not destroy ness **forgiveness but** only anger or **non-**forgiveness **will** do it.

M. If the commentary is read after studying these rules\* it will become quite clear.

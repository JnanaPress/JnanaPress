In practice, the process of l£vara Prayidhftna has to be carried out inside the heart,

The region inside the breast **where** the feeling of pleasure arises **when** there is love or happiness, and the feeling of sadness arises when there is unhappiness or fear, is called the heart. As a matter of fact, the location of tht heart has to be determined by following the feeling. It cannot be located by analysing the nerves, blood, sinews, etc. There is reflex action of the mental feeling of attachment, etc\* and we feel that in the heart, but where the mental action takes place we **Cannot** locate. Thai is **why** it is easier to get to **the** knower by meditation on the region of the heart. That region **is** thr centre of the 'I-feeling1. The brain is no donbt **the** centre of mental actions but if mental fluctuations are **Stopped** for a time, il can be felt that the T-5ensef is going down to the heart. When by meditation on the region of the heart, the subtle ']-feeling" is realised and it is pursued upward into the brain, then can the subtlest centre of T be located then the heart and the brain become one and the same.

Beginners who find it easier to do IsvaraTranidhftua with a God having a figure should imagine a luminous figure of God inside their hearts. As a liberated person is calm in mind and is blissful in face on account of his highest attainment, so shoufd the contemplated lioly figure in one's heart be imagined to be and it should be contemplated that one is fully associated with that figure. In repeating the mystic syllable OM, one should think oneself to be within the tiubltni —calm, carefree and felicitous.

## **Avidya {Misapprehension about the r«al nature of things), Aflmiti (Egaisni), Riga (Attachment), Dvesa (Antipathy) And Abbinivesi (Fear), Arc tbe five Kltaas (Afflictions). 3.**

**The afflictions are the five forms of wrong cognition (I). When they become active \*'.f, become manifest\* they strengthen the sway of the Gunas, bring about change, set in motion the flow of cause and effect and in conjunction with one another bring about the fructification ol" action.**

(I) The common Feature of all the afflictions is erroneous cognition which is a source of pain. When Kde£as prevail i.r. the afflictive modifications grow, and the real nature of the self remains unseen\* the productiveness of the l^uiias remains dwprooted. They\* in their turn, set in motion the operation of cause and effect from Avyakta (mimanifest) to Mahat (I-aetise). Kvery moment the Guyas change into Mahat, Ahamkilra etc. and as a result the afflictions lying at the root of the functions of Mahat etc- bring about the fruition of the actions.

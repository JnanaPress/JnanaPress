## ON CONCENTRATION

relating to the instruments of cognition and relating to objects cognised. There is also difference due to the nature of the engrossment. Yogins however take the two together to avoid multiplicity and divide them into Savitarka, Nirvitarka, Savichara and Nirvichara. Their difference is shown in the chart given below :-

Vitarka and Vichara and matters relating thereto have been dealt with before. Now Nirvitarka will be dealt with. All sorts of Dhyana, i.e. meditation which can be done by a mind which has not been closed entirely will fall within one or the other of the engrossments mentioned in the table above, because there is nothing other than an object, instrument of cognition and the cognition that can be contemplated.

(3) Samapatti, i.e. the habituated state of engrossment of mind on the subject contemplated upon through force of practice, has been fully explained by the maker of the Sutra as well as by the commentator. The latter has given examples

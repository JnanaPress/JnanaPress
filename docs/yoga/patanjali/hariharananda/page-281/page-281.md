this is both exhalation and suspension (of breath)\* Similarly, the internal operation also is a combination of inhalation and suspension of breath. In some books it is stated that the suspension of breath after exhalation is a Titntric form of Fr£n3ySma, and suspension after inhalation is the Vedic form of at, Thus, external operation etc, are not the same ns pure Rechaka, Pfiraka and Kumbhukn only as understood ill modern times.

The ancient processes of rRechakaf etc.p are similar to the processes described in the Voga philosophy.

The particular form of effort, -which brings about suspension\* may be described as an effort at contraction in all the limbs of the body. When that effort becomes firm, suspension of breath cati be maintained for a long timer otherwise it cannot be maintained for more than two or three minutes\* This should be clearly understood. (By inhaling oxygen, suspension of breath—not the suspension of FrSjia or vital energy—can be maintained up to eight or ten mimites.)

Iti the Hatha-Yoga that effort is called Mflla-Bsuidha (contraction of the anus), Uddly&na-Batidha (contraction of the abdomen), and Jidimdhara-Uaudba (contraction of the throat). The operation called Rhecliart-Mtulrii, is also similar. l:ur the practice of this posture, the tongue has to be repeatedly pulled to elongate it gradually. Pressing the extended tongue into the nasopharynx and applying pressure on the nerves then;in. or pulling them, it is possible to maintain suspension of breath and vital energies ( state of catalepsy ) for some time. As result of these efforts at contraction, the nerves being inclined towards suspension, the breath and life energy may be suspended- By the adoption of a particular form of diet, and practices performed with a healthy body, the nerves amt muscles attain a S;lttvika form of alacrity with the help of which this strong effort cau be made (Buddhists describe this alacrity as gentleness and dexterity of the body)\* This effort cannot be made with a flabby body which is not muscular, hence there arc instructions to make the body strong and perfectly healthy by ihe adoption of various postures and practices.

This is how the function of the Pr^ua (vital energies) can be stopped with Hatlift\* J\*Y enforced means\* This, however\*

Speed as of the mind means that the body acquires speed of movement comparable to that of the mind. Action of sense-organs in defiance of the body, means their action\* (without the necessity of the presence of the body) at any desired place\* or lime, or object. Mastery over the primordial causes means subjugation *of* constituent cause and its modifications.

Power over the primordial causes is the ultimate limit of the power of action.

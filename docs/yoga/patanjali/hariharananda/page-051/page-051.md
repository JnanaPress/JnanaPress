## **ON CONCENTRATION** 2D

CENTRAL LIBRARY

of Buddhi, the impact received at first through the senses, is Inter reflected in the pure 'I1. The centre of this reflection is *i*lit reflector of the Buddhi. To think that 'I txist1 is also the result of such reflection\* Tor all lower physical sensations or perceptions of objects, the centre of reflection is the Buddhi or the senses lower down. But the reflector of the Buddhi, which is the highest **form of** the phenomenal Self, is beyond the Buddhi ; that is the immutable consciousness or Purae\*\* This idea of reflection is the way of reaching the Purina principle\* After realising the principle of the pure '1-feeling1 by force of concentration, the Purina principle, the reflector, has to be realised by a process **of** meditation\* This really is Viveka-Kliyftti or final discriminative discernment\*

(6) Affinity and disability are the two kinds of relation ship\* Affinity means agreement in presence or agreement in absence! while disaflinily implies non-agreement in presence or absence. Broadly speaking, realising the nature of these kinds of relationship, having got a part of the relationship between two related things, to know the rest is inference\* When nonexistence of something is inferred, it implies the knowledge of the existence of some other things ; this has been explained before. This science is against the cognition of a non-existent or negative thing-

(7) From only words\* i.r\* from sentences composed of the cases and the verb\* But in every case there may not be a correct cognition. In some places doubts arise and in some the doubts are dispelled through inference. Bor example, "so and so is reliable, when lie says it, it must be true." From study also one can make sure\* This is inferential proof\* From this many think that Agama or verbal testimony is not a separate source of valid knowledge\* But it is not so. Some men are found naturally to possess the power to find out wlmt is in another mind, or can communicate his own thought into another\* They are called thought-readers, They also possess the power of thought-transference\* Telepathy is of this class\* If you think that a book is in such and such a place, that thought will at once rise in their mind, *i.t.* they will come to have a knowledge of the existence of the book in that place. How does the, cognition come to the thought-readers ? Not by direct perception.*-CO*

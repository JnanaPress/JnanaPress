**With gcutl dcjl of hesitation and full ul diffidence <sup>1</sup> Swantiji If <sup>I</sup> might venture upon this great task. Swami DbknUtnwghfl Araijya gave me every encouragement, placed the library of the monasterv at my dispoial and passed words to all members and monks of the monasteryâ€”both lay and ordained - to give me every assistance in the preparation of the book.**

*j.* **In the course of the intensive study, ncsessary for the preparation of faithful translation! backed by the elucidation and practical hints on Yoga front nty master, <sup>I</sup> realised the vasiness of the comprehension of the essential principles by the writer of Yogu-Darsasa before he could give such an csp^^iiioti of an abstruse subject like the ^ oga Philosophy, because nothing short of revelation in Samadhi could account for ihc wonderful insight -displayed in the book. Although there is nothing new to be said about the ultimate truths which had been stated by the original teachers In ancient times, the later commen tit tors have elucidated the methods lor comprehending those truths and with their incomparable genius and uncommon insight have shed lustre of tlielr clear intelligence m illuminating the anciertt wisdom of Yoga In Sw&mi t larihariinanda's exposition will be found many things which WII go to allay the doubts of ardent enquirers, to establish the appropriateness of the propositions enunciated, to elucidate many apparently unintelligible parts, as well as many new ^arguments which go to refute the criticism of adverse commentators. This convinced me that every word of the encomium so profusely bestowed on the liengali edition of Yoga-Duriana by [he learned scholars alt osci India was richly deserved. Experienced readers w ill feef that the commentaries in this book are not the elucidation of a writer who is engaged only in a task of explaining the text without seriously following that philosophy. H is 3 iKmk primarily for those whose lives have been dedicated to the principles of Samkhya-Yoga, who have to remove the doubts of many enquirers and who by (heir conduct and precept have to establish that knowledge.**

**Apart from its spiritual aspect, the philosophy of Yoga has a moral value and is of no small practical utility in our everyday life. The sages of old, in India.-codified the rules for disciplining the mind so that better human relations could develop which arc bound ultimately to bring about collective peace. It is a common error to assume that a too much philosophical attitude of mind is antagonistic to social progress, but a careful perusal of the Yoga philosophy would show that it is** *not* **tainted by sectarianism. its principles are of universal application, and that- its doctrines are not basically incompatible with human advancement ah round If the cardinal principles of human conduct enunciated in this philosophy are followed in practice, a bclier man will be built**

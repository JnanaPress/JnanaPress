to all men, they cannot give adequate reason for that statement. The doctrine of Karimt therefore appears to be inWC reasonable than the other two theories

(2} The commentator lias explained some general rules relating to the principleof Karma\* The commentary can be better followed if those rules are clearlyunderstood. They are

A\* One KarmSsaya is not responsible for many births. H it were so\* there would be no chance for the fruition of alt Karinas. In every birth many K.arm3^ayas are accumulated\* and it would then be difficult to find time for the fruition of all these. Therefore such statements as 'hilling of one animal will invoice millions of birth as animal' etc, are untenable\*

H, For the same reason the proposition that otic Karma brings about out birth canuot also be correct.

C. Many Karatas do not cause mativ births simultaneously, because many births at the same time is an impossibility.

D. That many KarmAiuyas go to bring about one birth appear\* to be the correct rule. In fact it is seen that in out. life the fruits of many actions arc experienced\* Therefore many Karinas would appear to be the cause of one birth.

K\* The Karin,1a ayas responsible for a birth also determine its span of life, and the experience of pleasure and pain therein is also brought about by them.

**I'\** Kartnainya Ekabhavika *i~\*.* is mainly accumulated in one life. Take <sup>X</sup> -previous birth and <sup>V</sup> **-** the **subsequent** birth. The KarmAsayas responsible for <sup>V</sup> have been mainly collected in X, Therefore KarmA^aya is Ekabliavika or of one birth. This is the general rule. The exception to this will be mentioned later. How KarmAsaya gathered in one life cause\* a subsequent ltte can be seen in the commentary.

(i. The outcome of KarmAsuya which will bear fruit in a future life is threefold *viz.* bitTh. duration of existence, am1 experience of pleasure and pain. Hut a\* the outcome of Karma which becomes operative its that very life does not entail another birth or species\* and if all the experience is felt in that Life.

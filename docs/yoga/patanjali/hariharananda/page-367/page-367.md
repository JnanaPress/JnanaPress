## **When The Cause Of Bondage Gets Relaxed And The Movements Of The Mind Art Known, The Mind Can Get Into Another Body. 33.**

As **the mind is naturally restless, on account of the latent impressions ol" previous actions, it gets tied up with the body (1). Through the power of concentration the tics created hy previous actions get loosened, and the movements of the mind get known. When the bonds of previous actions become weak and the movements of the mind over the nerves are known, the yogin can take out the mind from his own body and throw ii into another body.** As **when a king-bee flies, all bees follow it, and when it settles down, others do the same, so do Lhe sense energies follow the mind as it enters another body,**

(1) 'I am the body'—impelled by this notion, the mim! is rooming from object to object every moment. The impression 'I am not the body\*, does not last long in distracted mind. That is what causes tlic attachment to the body. Moreover, the bodv is the creation of latent impressions of previous actions. As long as activity goes on, the rtuud containing the latent impressions of the actions will continne to be associated with the body. When through concentration the knowledge that fI am not the bodygets fixed and the actions of the body slop, the mind becomes **free** from the body. Through sublie insight gained by concentration\* the movement of the mind along the nerves gets to be known. In this way can a yog in's mind be thrown into another body to influence it\*

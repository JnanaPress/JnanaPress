## Karma Is £ith«r Fast In Fructifying Or Slow In Fruition, **By Practising Samyania On Them Or On Portents, Fore-Knowledge Of Death Can Be Acquired. 22.**

Karma (deeds) which fructifies as life-period is of two kinds, some which fructify quickly (Sopakrama), and others which fructify slowly (Nitnpakrama) (I). For example, when a wet cloth is spread out it dries quickly, whereas if kept in a lump it takes longer lime. As fire igniting dry grass, ii fanned on all sides by wind, consumes the grass quickly so does fast fructifying Karma ; while slow fructifying Karma is like fire applied gradually in different places to a heap of grass, thus taking longer time to burn. Karma of one period of existence causing life-period is thus of two varieties.. By practising Sarhyama on them knowledge of cud oT this life can be gathered. It can also he gained from portents.

Portents arc of three kintis—personal, elemental and divine. 'lie personal ones are like, not hearing any sound within the body on closing the cars, or not seeing any ediligent light on the eyes being closed **(pressed** by fingers). The example of elemental portents is seeing ihc messengers of the Cod of death or the wraiths oT departed forefathers. The divine portents are like seeing **Lite** heavens or ihe Siddhas (cthcreals) suddenly, or seeing everything contrary to those seen before.

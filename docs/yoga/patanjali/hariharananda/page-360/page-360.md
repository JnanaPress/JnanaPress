#### YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATANJALI

organs round the navel as the central point, knowledge can be gained of the bodily system.

In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, wind, bile, and phlegm are regarded as the roots of all ailments. Susruta says that this division follows the three Gunas or constituent principles, viz. Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Thus wind is disturbance of the sentient functions, bile of the mutative functions and phlegm of the retentive functions. In fact, a review of their symptoms supports this view.

As from Samkhya philosophy have been gained the highest rules of conduct like Ahimsa, truth etc. and the whole world has benefited from the doctrines of Yoga, so has mankind obtained the first principles of medical science therefrom.

## कगढकूपे जुल्पिपासानिवृत्तिः ॥ ३० ॥

भाष्यम्-जिन्नाया भ्रषस्तात्त्वः, ततोऽधस्तात्कय्छः, ततोऽधस्तात्कूपः, तत्व संयमात् चतिपपासि न वाधिते । ३० ।

### On The Trachea, Hunger And Thirst Can Be Subdued. 30.

Below the tongue are the vocal cords and the larynx, and below that is trachea. On practising Samyama on trachea hunger and thirst can be avoided (1).

(1) When by Samyama on the trachea a calm and placid feeling is gained, the feelings of hunger and thirst are also conquered. The feelings of hunger and thirst arise in the alimentary canal no doubt but sometimes nervous action can be better controlled from a distance.

# कूर्मनाद्यां स्वयंम् ॥ ३१ ॥

भाष्यम्-कूपाद्द्ध उरसि कूर्माकारा नाड़ी. तस्यां क्वतसंयम: स्थिरपद लमते, यथा सर्वो गोधा वेति ॥ ३१ ॥

## Calmness Is Attained By Samyama On The Bronchial Tube. 31.

Within the breast, below the trachea is a tortoiseshaped tube, by Samyama on which freedom from restlessness can be secured, as a snake or an iguana does (1).

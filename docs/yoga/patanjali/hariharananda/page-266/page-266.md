## **244 YOGA PHILOSOPHY OF PATASjau**

To inflict pain on an animal personally is injuring directly, To purchase meat is getting injury done by another ; while approval is to commend injury done by another to an enemy or to a fierce animal, by saying that he has done well in killing that man or snake. This kind of harm is again done either in anger, through greed or under a delusion, *t.g.* holding that f^od has created some animals to be eaten by men.

Yogi us should take particular care to see that there is not the least contamination through the sin of causing harm etc. Then only the purest form of yogic virtue appears.

(2) Sin of unrestricted fruition implies the sin that fructifies fully iu this life, i,t. until the effect of the action which has brought about the misery is ended, it goes on givltig pain until death ends the life.

(3) Removed or suppressed means not becoming effective through force of virtue. On that account the result of harm docs not fully manifest itself but it shortens the life of the individual. The word 'Apagata' does not mean destruction but failure to produce adequate result.

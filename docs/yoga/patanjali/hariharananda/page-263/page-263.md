## ON PRACTICE

स्तुल्यः म्बद्धत्तेन द्रति भावयेत् । यथा मता वान्तावले हो तथा त्यक्तस्य पुनराद्द्रान दृत्येवमादि सूत्रान्तरेखापि योज्यम् ॥३३॥

## When These Abstentions And Observances Are Inhibited By Perverse Thoughts There Should Be Thought Of The Opposites (1). 33.

When the knower of Brahman gets feelings of hatred etc. and is inhibited by the blazing heat of perverse thoughts such as "I shall kill him who hurts me, I shall speak untruth, I shall take his things, I shall commit adultery with his wife, I shall take things belonging to others", he should think of their opposites in this way : "Roasted on the pitiless burning coal of the round of rebirths, I took refuge in the virtues of Yoga by promising security to all beings. After having abjured such perverse thoughts I am behaving like a dog in betaking myself to them. As a dog licks his vomits, so it is to take to things abandoned". Such kinds of opposite or contrary thoughts are to be practised also in respect of the methods prescribed in the other Sutras.

(1) Vitarka = Perverse thoughts-which give rise to actions opposed to the ten rules of Yama and Niyama (restraints and observances)-like harmlessness etc. They are-harm, untruth, theft, incontinence, avarice ; and uncleanliness, discontent, unendurance, talkativeness, thinking of the character of low persons or of ungodly attributes.

भाष्यम्-तत्र हिंसा तावत्सता कारिता जुमोदितीति विधा। एकैका पुनस्त्रिधा, लोमेन-मांसचर्मार्थिन, कोधेन-श्रपक्षतमनिनिति, मोहेन-धर्मों मे भविष्यतोति । लोभक्रीधमोहा: पुनस्त्रविधाः म्हुदुमध्याधिमात्रा द्रति । एवं O.P. 132-31

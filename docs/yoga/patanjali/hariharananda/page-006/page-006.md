## FOREWORD

**]| is a matter of no small satisfaction to me to we an English rendering of the Patanjala Yogadarsuna or the Yoga Philosophy of Pataiijali as presented by rtiy revered Aeharvd. the laic S&rhkhya\*Yogacharya Srimat Swami Hanha rananda Arunya. ]| was an object of great regret with him thal in the later years of his life he could not arrange for this great task for which he was gening repeated requests. His exposition or the subject in liengali bears remarkable impress of his genius a\* well as evidence of realisation of the subtle principles which constitute the basis Of the Saiiikhya-Yoga philosophy. This philosophy\* propounded at an age when writing had not been invented, and when sacred learning was ora lly transmitted from master to pupil, was naturally very concise and depended for its clear exposition on the mental conception of those to whom it was communicated. A good deal thus depended on the comprehension of the principles enunciated in Ehc form of aphorisms, to achieve Which intense study and strict habits of life were essential With the passage of time, Ehcsc became scarce arc! so the ancient lore would have become extinct had it not been kept alive by the commentaries of subsequent thinkers. With the advent of modern age, such thinkers also became few and far between\* except for the rare appearance of a savant who would go into voluntary exile and devote his life to assimilate [hose ancient doctrines leading to the transcendental goal.**

**The treatise on Samkhya-Yoga philosophy as framed by Patafijah'\* is divided into four parts : (i) On concentration. (ii} On Practice, (iii) On Supernormal Powers, and (tvl On Isolation. Although extremely condensed and appearing as detached, iherc is an underlying logical continuity through the aphorisms and the four different parts\* which makes them a complete and broadbttscd structure. That is why this philosophy has successfully withstood the onslaught of ticnc and still continues to infuse spiritual inspiration and showr the unerring path of salvation.**

**Though ii is called Yoga Philosophy ihc terms J^arsana and philosophy are i\*pt exactly synonymous. Yoga Dsr&ana is not a general theoretical dissertation on mental science\* like what is meant by philosophy. Its theme is to ascertain the aim of life by finding out the** *ultima rhulr* **of human desires, to discover (he root cause of all sorts of afflictions and then to prescribe the supreme remedy. It is noticeable how that has been done in a perfectly scientific way thus making it**

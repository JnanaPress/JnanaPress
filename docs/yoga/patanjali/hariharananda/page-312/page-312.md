## **Repression Of Attention To AH And Development Of One-Pyjittedness It Called Samiidbi-Parinama Or Conccntrative Mutation Of The Mind, II.**

**Attending to all (1)** *is* **a characteristic of the tnind ; ouc-poiti ted ness is also a characteristic of the mind. Curtailment of the habit of attending to all means its disappearance and the appearance of omvpointedness. It is the same mind that owns both these states. Mind gets engrossed under the influence of its own actiont** *viz.* **the curtailment of its habit of serving all and the growth of its habit of attention to one. That is known as Samadhiparinama of the mind or mutation in the practice of concentration\***

£l) Attending to all = Always receiving everything, t,^ rt'stleaijctss, Mind being always engaged in taking in sound, touch, light, taste and smell **and** in thinking of the past and the future, is attending to all or being directed to **all.** To be naturally ready to take in everything is the habit of attending to all. ,

Gne-poittttdtiess is likewise getting the attention fixed on one subject—to be naturally attached to one thing. Attenuation of the spirit of attend mg to all and the increase and development of the linbit of attending to only one object, is the Samfidbiparipama of the mind. When the mind is engaged in practising concentration it is affected in that way.

Nirodha-paTiiiilma or reduction to a closed state referred lo before, relates to suppression and uprising of subliminal impressions. Samftdbi-pariuAnia or concentrative attenuation is suppression and rise of both latent impressions and of Cognised modifications. The reduction of the latent impression of the habit of taking in everything with its cognised impressions, and the development of the latent impressions of the liabit of one-pointedness, hr, the habit of keeping one object before the mind, constitute the features of Sam&tibi-parinAma.

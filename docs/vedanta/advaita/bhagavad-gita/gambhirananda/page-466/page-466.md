*Chittvā*, after felling, uprooting, together with its seeds; *enam*, this, above described; *aśvattham*, Peepul, the Tree of the World; *suvirūḍha-mūlam*, whose roots (*mūla*) are well (*su*) developed (*virūḍham*); *drḍhena*, with the strong—hardened by a resolute mind directed towards the supreme Self, and sharpened on the stone of repeated practice of discrimination; *asanga-śastrena*, sword of detachment—detachment means turning away from the desire for progeny, wealth and the worlds; with that sword of detachment—.

As to how It is to be sought for, the Bhagavān says: *Prapadye*, I take refuge; *tam*, in that; *ādyam*, Primeval—existing from the beginning; *purusam*, Person, who has been mentioned by the word *State*; *eva*, Himself. The search has to be carried on thus, that is, by taking refuge in Him.

Who is that Person? That is being stated: *Yatah*, from whom, from which Person; *prasrtā*, has ensued, like jugglery from a magician; *purānī*, the eternal; *pravrttih*, Manifestation, the magic Tree of the World.

What kind of persons reach that State? This is being answered:

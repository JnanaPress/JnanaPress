and others. Thus it is of three kinds. *Srnu*, hear; *tām*, about it, that faith, as it is being stated.

That (faith) is threefold as follows:

## सवानुपा सवय ा भवित भारत। ामयोऽयं पुषो यो य: स एव स:॥३॥

3. O scion of the Bharata dynasty, the faith of all beings is in accordance with their minds. This person is made up of faith as the dominant factor. He is verily what his faith is.

O scion of the Bharata dynasty, the *śraddhā*, faith; *sarvasya*, of all beings; *bhavati*, is; *sattva-anurūpā*, in accordance with their minds, in accordance with the internal organ which is imbued with particular impression. If this is so, what follows? The answer is: *Ayam*, this; *purusah*, person, the transmigrating Ātman; is *śraddhāmayah*, made up of faith as the dominating factor. How? *Sah*, he, the individual Ātman; is *eva*, verily; *sah*, that; *yah yatśraddhah*, which is the faith of that individual—he surely conforms to his faith.

And, as a consequence, a person's steadfastness in *sattva* etc. is to be inferred from the grounds of his actions such as worship of gods etc. Hence the Bhagavān says:

## यजते सािवका देवायरिस राजसा:। ेताभूतगणाये यजते तामसा जना:॥४॥

4. Those having the *sattva* quality worship the gods; those having *rajas*, the demi-gods and ogres; and other people possessed of *tamas* worship ghosts and the hosts of spirits.

*Sāttvikāh*, those having the *sattva* quality, those steadfast in *sattva*; *yajante*, worship; *devān*, the gods; *rājasāh*, those having *rajas*; (worship) *yaksa-raksāṁsi*, the demi-gods and ogres; and *anye*, other; *janāh*, people; *tāmasāh*, possessed of *tamas*; *yajante*, worship; *pretān*, ghosts; and *bhūta-ganān*, the hosts of spirits— Sapta-mātrkās (the Seven Mothers) and others.

22. O son of Kuntī, a person who is free from these three doors to darkness strives for the good of the Ātman. Thereby he attains the highest Goal.

O son of Kuntī, *narah*, a person; who is *vimuktah*, free; *etaih*, from these; *tribhih*, three; *tamo-dvāraih*, doors to darkness, that is, passion etc. which are doors to the darkness of hell consisting of sorrow and delusion; freed from these three which are such, *ācarati*, strives for;—for what?—*śreyah*, the good; *ātmanah*, of the Ātman: debarred by which (doors) he could not strive earlier, and on the dispelling of which he strives. *Tatah*, thereby, as a result of that striving; *yāti*, he attains; the *parām*, supreme; *gatim*, Goal, that is Liberation, as well.

*Utsrjya*, ignoring, setting aside; *śāstra-vidhim*, the precept of the scriptures, which is the source of the knowledge of what is duty and what is not—called injunction and prohibition; *yah*, he who; *vartate*, acts; *kāma-kāratah*, under the impulsion of passion; *sah*, he; *na*, does not; *avāpnoti*, attain; *siddhim*, perfection, fitness for Liberation; nor even *sukham*, happiness in this world; nor even the *parām*, supreme, best; *gatim*, Goal—heaven or Liberation.

## तमाछां माणं ते कायकाययविथतौ। ावा शािवधानोतं कम कतु िमहाहिस॥२४॥

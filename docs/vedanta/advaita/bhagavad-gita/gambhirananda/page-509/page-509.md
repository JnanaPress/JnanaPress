## असिदयु यते पाथ न च तेय नो इह॥२८॥

28. O son of Prthā, whatever is offered in sacrifice and given in charity, as also whatever austerity is undertaken or whatever is done without faith, is said to be of no avail. And it is of no consequence after death, nor here.

O son of Prthā, whatever is *hutam*, offered in sacrifice, poured as oblation; and *dattam*, given in charity to Brāhmanas, *aśraddhayā,* without faith; whatever *tapah*, austerity; is *taptam*, performed without faith; so also, whatever is *krtam*, done without faith, e.g. praise, salutation, etc.; all that *ucyate*, is said to be; *asat iti*, of no avail, since it is outside the course of disciplines leading to Me. *Ca*, and, although involving great effort; *na ca tat*, it is of no consequence; *pretya*, after death, for producing (some) result; *na*, nor even for any result; *iha*, because it is condemned by the wise.

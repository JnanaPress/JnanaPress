of the king of gods, which is the result of righteousness, they enjoy in heaven the divine pleasure of gods.

Those, again, who are ignorant and desirous of pleasures, *traividyāh*, who are versed in the three Vedas, who know the rk, Yajus and Sāma Vedas; *somapāh*, who are drinkers of Soma; and who, as a result of that very drinking of Soma, are *pūta-pāpāh*, purified of sin; *prārthayante*, pray for; the *svargatim*, heavenly goal, the attainment of heaven—heaven itself being the goal [\(149\)](#page--1-0)—; *isṭvā*, by worshipping; *mām*, Me, existing in the forms of gods such as the Vasus and others; *yajñaih*, through sacrifices such as the Agnisṭoma etc. And *āsādya*, having reached; *surendra-lokam*, the place (world) of the king of gods, of Indra; (which is) *punyam*, the result of righteousness; *te*, they; *aśnanti*, enjoy; *divi*, in heaven; the *devyān*, divine, heavenly, supernatural; *deva-bhogān*, pleasures of gods.

ते तं भुवा वगलोकं िवशालं ीणे पु ये मयलोकं िवशित। एवं ैधयमनुपा गतागतं कामकामा लभते॥२१॥

21. After having enjoyed that vast heavenly world, they enter into the human world on the exhaustion of their merit. Thus, those who follow the rites and duties prescribed in the three Vedas, and are desirous of pleasures, attain the state of going and returning.

*Bhuktvā*, after having enjoyed; *tam*, that: *viśālam*, vast; *svargalokam*, heavenly world; *te*, they; *viśanti*, enter into; this *martyalokam*, human world; *ksīne*, on the exhaustion; of their *punye*, merit. *Evam*, thus, indeed; *anuprapannāh*, those who follow in the manner described; *trai-dharmyam*, [\(150\)](#page--1-1) the rites and duties prescribed in the three Vedas—merely the Vedic rites and duties; and are *kāma-kāmāh*, desirous of pleasures; *labhante*, attain; only *gata-āgatam*, the state of going and returning, but never that of independence. This is the meaning.

not defiled.

*Yathā*, as; *sarva-gatam*, the all-pervading; *ākāśam*, space; though pervasive, still, *na upalipyate*, is not defiled, does not come into contact; *sauksmyāt*, because of its subtlety; *tathā*, similarly; *ātmā*, the Self; *avasthitah*, present, *sarvatra*, everywhere; *dehe*, in the body; *na*, is not; *upalipyate*, defiled.

Further,

## यथा काशययेक: कृ नं लोकिममं रिव:। ें ेी तथा कृ नं काशयित भारत॥३३॥

33. As the single sun illumines this whole world, similarly, O descendant of the Bharata dynasty, the Knower of the field illumines the whole field.

*Yathā*, as; *ekam*, the one; *ravih*, sun; *prakāśayati*, illumines; *imam*, this; *krtsnam*, whole; *lokam*, world *tathā*, similarly;—who? *ksetrī*, the Knower of the field, that is the supreme Self, though one; *prakāśayati*, illumines; *krtsnam*, the whole; *ksetram*, field, from the 'great elements' to 'fortitude' (cf. 5-6).

Here the illustration of the sun serves to highlight two aspects of the Self, viz. that, like the sun, the Self is one in all the fields, and that It remains unaffected.

This verse is meant for summarizing the idea of the whole of this chapter:

## ेेयोरेवमतरं ानचुषा। भूतकृ ितमों च ये िवदय ु ित ते परम्॥३४॥

34. Those who know thus through the eye of wisdom the distinction between the field and the Knower of the field, and the annihilation of the Matrix of beings,—they reach the Supreme.

*Ye*, those who; *viduh*, know; *evam*, thus, in the manner described above; *jñāna-caksusā*, through the eye of wisdom—the *eye* is the realization in the form of the knowledge of the Self, which arises from

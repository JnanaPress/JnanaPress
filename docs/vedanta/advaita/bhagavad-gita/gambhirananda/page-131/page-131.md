continuing, because of past momentum, to be associated with action itself—without renouncing it—with a view to preventing mankind from going astray. Again, if (it be that) Janaka and others had not attained fullest realization, then, they gradually became established in Liberation through action which is a means for the purification of the mind. The verse is to be explained thus.

'If you have a doubt here with regard to the duty of preventing people from straying, then why do you not observe Me?'

*Āhuh*, they, the wise persons, say; that *phalam*, the result; *sukrtasya*, of good; *karmanah*, work, that is acts having the *sattva* quality; is verily *nirmalam*, pure; and is *sāttvikam*, born of *sattva*. *Tu*, but; *phalam*, the result; *rajasah*, of *rajas*, that is of acts that have the quality of *rajas*—for the topic relates to actions; is *duhkham*, sorrow. In accordance with its cause, the result too is indeed sorrow, a product of *rajas*. So also *ajñānam*, ignorance; is, as before, (the result) *tamasah*, of *tamas*, of unrighteous acts that have the quality of *tamas*.

## ऊवं गछित सवथा मये ितित राजसा:। जघयगुणवृ था अधो गछित तामसा:॥१८॥

18. People who conform to *sattva* go higher up; those who conform to *rajas* stay in the middle; those who conform to *tamas*, who conform to the actions of the lowest quality, go down.

*Sattvasthāh*, people who conform to *sattva*, to the actions of *sattva* quality; *gacchanti*, go, are born; *ūrdhvam*, higher up, in the worlds of gods and others. *Rājasāh*, those who conform to *rajas*; [\(146\)](#page--1-2) *tisṭhanti*, stay, are born; *madhye*, in the middle, among human beings. *Tāmasāh*, those who conform to *tamas*, *jaghanya-*

undesirable things; (*vyavasthitau*, are ordained,) are sure to occur, *arthe*, with regard to objects such as sound etc.; *indriyasya indriyasya*, of all the organs, with regard to each of the organs.

As to that, the scope of personal effort and scriptural purpose are being stated as follows: One who is engaged in the subject-matter of the scriptures should, in the very beginning, not come under the influence of love and hatred. For, that which is the nature of a person impels him to his actions, verily under the influence of love and hatred. And then follow the rejection of one's own duty and the undertaking of somebody else's duty. On the other hand, when a person controls love and hatred with the help of their opposites, [\(52\)](#page--1-0) then he becomes mindful only of the scriptural teachings; he ceases to be led by his nature.

Even *nidhanam*, death; is *śreyah*, better; while engaged *svadharme*, in one's own duty, as compared with remaining alive while engaged in somebody else's duty. Why? *Para-dharmah*, another's duty; is

burning away the seed of the evil of transmigration!'—in this way the Bhagavān expresses regret. And what is the source of that ignorance in the world? That is being stated:

## ििभगु ;णमयैभवैरेिभ: सविमदं जगत्। मोिहतं नािभजानाित मामेय: परमययम्॥१३॥

13. All this world, deluded as it is by these three things made of the *gunas* (qualities), does not know Me who am transcendental to these and undecaying.

*Sarvam*, all; *idam*, this; *jagat*, world, the aggregate of creatures; *mohitam*, deluded as it is—made to have indiscrimination; *ebhih*, by these; aforesaid *tribhih*, three; *bhavaih*, things, in the forms of attachment, repulsion, delusion, etc; and *gunamayaih*, made of the *gunas*, of the transformations of the *gunas*; *na abhijānāti*, does not know; *mām*, Me; who am *param*, transcendental to, distinct, different; *ebhyah*, from these *gunas* as referred to above; and am *avyayam*, undecaying, that is free from all (the six kinds of) changes in things, viz. birth etc. [\(100\)](#page--1-0)

*Hi*, since; *esā*, this, aforesaid; *daivī*, divine; Māyā *mama*, of Mine, of Bhagavān, of Visnu, which (Māyā) is My own; and which is *gunamayī*, constituted by the *gunas*; is *duratyayā*, difficult to cross over; therefore, this being so, *ye*, those who; wholeheartedly *prapadyante*, take refuge; *mām eva*, in Me alone, in Me who am the Master of Māyā and who am their own Self, by giving up all forms of rites and duties; *te*, they; *taranti*, cross over; *etām*, this; *māyām*, Māyā, which

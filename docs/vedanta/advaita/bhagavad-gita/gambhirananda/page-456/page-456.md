does not long for them in that way; *nivrttāni*, when they disappear. This is the idea.

This is not an indication that can be perceived by others. What then? Since this characteristic is perceivable to oneself, it is merely subjective. For dislike or longing, which is a subjective experience of a person, is not seen by another.

Now, then, the Bhagavān gives the reply to the question, 'What is the behaviour of one who has gone beyond the qualities?':

8. Whatever action one may relinquish merely as being painful, from fear of physical suffering, he, having resorted to renunciation based on *rajas*, will surely not acquire the fruits of renunciation.

*Yat*, whatever; *karma*, action; *tyajet*, one may relinquish, *eva*, merely; *iti*, as being; *duhkham*, painful; [\(200\)](#page--1-0) *kāya-kleśa- bhayāt*, from fear of physical suffering, out of fear of bodily pain; *sah*, he; *krtvā*, having resorted; *tyāgam*, to renunciation; *rājasam*, based on *rajas*, arising from *rajas*; will *eva*, surely; *na labhet* (should rather be *labhate*), not acquire; *tyāga-phalam*, fruits of renunciation, the result called Liberation, which follows from renunciation of all actions as a consequence of Illumination.

Which, again, is the renunciation based on *sattva*?

## कायिमयेव यकम िनयतं ियते ऽजु न। सं यवा फलं चैव स याग: सािवको मत:॥९॥

9. Whatever obligatory duty is performed just because it is a bounden duty, O Arjuna, by giving up attachment and the result as well,—that renunciation is considered to be based on *sattva*.

*Yat*, whatever; *niyatam karma*, daily obligatory duty; *kriyate*, is performed, accomplished; *iti eva*, just because; it is *kāryam*, a bounden duty; O Arjuna, *tyaktvā*, by giving up; *sangam*, attachment; and *phalam*, the result; *ca eva*, as well; *sah*, that; *tyāgah*, renunciation, giving up of attachment and (hankering for) the results of daily obligatory duties; *matah*, is considered; to be *sāttvikah*, based on *sattva*, arising from *sattva*.

We said that the Bhagavān's utterance is proof of the fruitfulness of daily obligatory duties. Or, even if the *nityakarmas* be understood (from the Bhagavān's words) to be fruitless, still the ignorant man does certainly imagine that the *nityakarmas* (daily obligatory duties) when performed produce for oneself a result either in the form of purification of the mind or avoidance of evil. As to this, the Bhagavān aborts even that imagination by saying, 'by giving up the result'. Hence it has been well said, 'by giving up attachment and the result'.

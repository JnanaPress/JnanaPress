'For this reason also, i.e., by seeing Your power of Yog, I infer' that—

## वमरं परमं वेिदतयं वमय िवय परं िनधानम्। वमयय: शातधमगोता सनातनवं पुषो मतो मे॥१८॥

18. You are the Immutable, the supreme One to be known; You are the most perfect repository of this Universe. You are the Imperishable, the Protector of the ever-existing religion; You are the eternal Person. This is my belief.

*Tvam*, You; are the *aksaram*, Immutable; the *paramam*, supreme One, Brahman; *veditavyam*, to be known—by those aspiring for Liberation. You are the *param*, most perfect; *nidhānam*, repository where things are deposited, that is the ultimate resort; *asya viśvasya*, of this Universe, of the entire creation. Further. You are the *avyayah*, Imperishable—there is no decay in You; the *śāśvatadharma-goptā*, Protector (*goptā*) of the ever-existing (*śāśvata*) religion (*dharma*). You are the *sanātanah*, eternal; transcendental *purusah*, Person. This is *me*, my; *matah*, belief—what is meant by me.

Moreover,

## अनािदमयातमनतवीय- मनतबाहं ु शिशसूयने म्। पयािम व दीतहत ु ाशवं वतेजसा िविमदं तपतम्॥१९॥

19. I see You as without beginning, middle and end, possessed of infinite valour, having innumerable arms, having the sun and the moon as eyes, having a mouth like a blazing fire, and heating up this Universe by Your own brilliance.

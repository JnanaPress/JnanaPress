Becoming *samah*, the same; *sarvesu bhūtesu*, towards all beings —that is, he verily judges what is happiness and sorrow in all beings by the same standard as he would apply to himself (cf. 6.32); but the meaning is not 'seeing the Self alike in all beings', for this will be spoken of in (the next verse), 'Through devotion he knows Me'—; he, the one who is of this kind and steadfast in Knowledge, *labhate*, attains; *parām*, supreme; *madbhaktim*, devotion to Me, to the supreme Bhagavān; (he attains) devotion which is described as Knowledge, as the 'fourth' in, '...four classes of people … adore Me' (7.16).

This being so, the utterance, 'having given up all actions mentally' (5.13), etc. as also, 'Being devoted to his own duty' (45) and 'A human being achieves success by adoring Him through his own duties (46)', becomes justifiable.

What was verily spoken of as the success arising from Karma (- Yog), characterized as the *fitness* for steadfastness in Knowledge, the fruit of that (fitness), characterized as 'steadfastness in Knowledge' consisting in the perfection in the form of the state of one (that is a monk) free from duties, has to be stated.

One is said to be free from duties from whom duties have departed as a result of realizing that the actionless Brahman is his Self; his state is *naiskarmyam*. That *siddhi* (perfection) which is this *naiskarmya* is *naiskarmya-siddhi*. Or, this phrase means 'achievement of *naiskarmya*', that is, achievement of the state of remaining established in one's own real nature as the actionless Self —which is different from the success arising from Karma (-Yog), and

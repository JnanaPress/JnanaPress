intellects; *sarvasya*, of all, of all creatures. For these three are, indeed, perceived there.

This verse is begun for concluding the topic under discussion:

## इित ें तथा ानं ेयं चोतं समासत:। मत एतिाय मावायोपपते॥१८॥

18. Thus has been spoken of in brief the field as also Knowledge and the Knowable. By understanding this My devotee becomes qualified for My state.

*Iti*, thus; *uktam*, has been spoken — commencing from 'I shall speak of that which is to be known' (12) and ending with 'It is spoken of as beyond darkness' (17); *samāsatah*, in brief; the *ksetram*, field beginning with the 'great elements' and ending with 'fortitude' (5,6); *tathā*, as also; *jñānam*, Knowledge—beginning from 'humility' (7) and ending with 'contemplation on the Goal of the knowledge of Reality' (11); and the *jñeyam*, Knowable.

All this has been stated by way of summarizing the purport of the Vedas and the *Gītā*. Who is fit for this true knowledge?

He attains Liberation.

And it has also been said, '(Understand thus) that all things have these as their source' (7.6). The explanation as to how creatures have the two aspects, the field and the Knower of the field, as their source is now being stated:

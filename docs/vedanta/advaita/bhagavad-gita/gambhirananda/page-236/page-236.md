whose sleep and wakefulness are temperate.

*Yogh bhavati*, Yog becomes; *duhkha-hā*, a destroyer of sorrow that which destroys (*hanti*) all sorrows (*duhkhāni*)—, that is, Yog destroys all worldly sorrows; *yukta-āhāra-vihārasya*, of one whose eating and movements are regulated—*āhāra* (lit. food) means all that is gathered in, [\(78\)](#page--1-0) and *vihāra* means moving about, walking; one for whom these two are regulated (*yukta*) is *yukta-āhāra-vihāra*—; and also *yukta-cesṭasya*, of one whose effort (*cesṭā*) is moderate (*yukta*); *karmasu*, in works; similarly, *yukta-svapna-avabodhasya*, of one whose sleep (*svapna*) and wakefulness (*avabodha*) are temperate (*yukta*), have regulated periods. To him whose eating and movements are regulated, whose effort in work is moderate, whose sleep and wakefulness are temperate, Yog becomes a destroyer of sorrows.

When does a man become concentrated? That is being presently stated:

## यदा िविनयतं िचमामयेवावितते। िन:पृह: सवकामेयो युत इयु यते तदा॥१८॥

18. A man who has become free from hankering for all desirable objects is then said to be Self-absorbed when the controlled mind rests in the Self alone.

A yogī, *nihsprhah*, who has become free from hankering, thirst; *sarva-kāmebhyah*, for all desirable objects, seen and unseen; is *tada*, then; *ucyate*, said to be; *yuktah*, Self-absorbed; *yadā*, when; the *viniyatam*, controlled; *cittam*, mind, the mind that has been made fully one-pointed by giving up thought of external objects; *avatisṭhate*, rests; *ātmani eva*, in the non-dual Self alone, that is he gets established in his own Self.

An illustration in being given for the mind of that yogī which has become Self-absorbed:

यथा दीपो िनवातथो ने ते सोपमा मृता।

form of the son of Vasudeva; *caturbhujena*, with four hands. The idea is: withdrawing the Cosmic form, appear in that very form as the son of Vasudeva.

*Shri Hari said:*

47. Out of grace, O Arjuna, this supreme, radiant, Cosmic, infinite, primeval form—which (form) of Mine has not been seen before by anyone other than you, has been shown to you by Me through the power of My own Yog.

*Prasannena*, out of grace — grace means the intention of favouring you; O Arjuna, *idam*, this; *param*, supreme; *tejomayam*, abundantly radiant; *viśvam*, Cosmic, all-comprehensive; *anantam*, infinite, limitless; *adyam*, primeval—that which existed in the beginning; *rūpam*, form, the Cosmic form; *yat* which form; *me*, of Mine; *na drsṭa-pūrvam*, has not been seen before; *tvat-anyena*, by anyone other than you; *darśitam*, has been shown; *tava*, to you; *mayā*, by Me—who am gracious, being possessed of that (intention of favouring you); *ātma-yogāt*, through the power of My own Yog, through the power of My own Bhagavānhood.

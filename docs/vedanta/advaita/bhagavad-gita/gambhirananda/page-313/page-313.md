*Kim punah*, what to speak of; the *punyāh brāhmanāh*, holy Brāhmanas, of sacred birth; *tathā*, as also; of the *bhaktāh*, devout; *rājarsayah*, king-sages—those who are kings and, at the same time, sages! Since this is so, therefore, *prāpya*, having come; *imam*, to this; *anityam*, ephemeral, ever changeful; and *asukham*, miserable, unhappy; *lokam*, world, the human world—having attained this human life which is a means to Liberation; *bhajasva*, do you worship, devote yourself; *mām* to Me.

How?

## ममना भव मतो माजी म नमकु । मामेवैयिस युवैवमामानं मपरायण:॥३४॥

34. Having your mind fixed on Me, be devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, and bow down to Me. By concentrating your mind and accepting Me as the supreme Goal, you shall surely attain Me who am thus the Self.

*Manmanā bhava*, have your mind fixed on Me; [\(161\)](#page--1-0) and also be *madbhaktah*, devoted to Me. *Madyājī*, sacrifice to Me, be engaged in sacrificing to Me. And *namaskuru*, bow down; only *mām*, to Me. *Yuktvā*, by concentrating your mind; and *mat-parāyanah*, by accepting Me as the supreme Goal; *esyasi eva*, you shall surely attain; *mām*, Me who am Bhagavān. You shall attain Me *evam ātmānam*, who am thus the Self: I indeed am the Self of all the beings, and am also the supreme Goal. You shall attain Me who am such. In this way, the word *ātmānam* (Self) is to be connected with the preceding word *mām* (Me). This is the purport.

## *CHAPTER 12 BHAKTI–YOG*

भयोगः

'In the chapters beginning with the second and ending with that on the divine manifestations (Chapter 10) has been stated the meditation on the supreme Self, Brahman, the Immutable, devoid of all qualifications. And, in various places, has also been stated the meditation on You, who are Bhagavān possessed of all mystical powers [\(62\)](#page--1-0) and the power of omniscience, and have the quality of *sattva* as the limiting adjunct. But in the chapter on "The Revelation of the Cosmic Form", the primal, divine Cosmic form of Yours comprising the whole Universe has been revealed by You for the sake of meditation itself! And after revealing that, You have said, "… he who works for Me," etc. (11.55). Therefore, [\(63\)](#page--1-1) in order to learn which is the better of these two views, I ask you,'—

*Arjuna said:*

## एवं सततयुता ये भताव पयु पासते। ये चायरमयतं तेष के योगिवमा:॥१॥

1. Those devotees who, being thus ever dedicated, meditate on You, and those again (who meditate) on the Immutable, the Unmanifested—of them, who are the best experiencers of Yog? [\(64\)](#page--1-2)

The subject-matter stated in the immediately preceding verse, '... he who works for Me,' etc. is referred to by the word *evam* (thus).

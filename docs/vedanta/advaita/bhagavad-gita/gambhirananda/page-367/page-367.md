*Sanjaya said—*

इयजु नं वासुदेवतथोवा वकं पं दशयामास भूय:। आासयामास च भीतमेनं भू वा पुन: सौयवपुमहामा॥५०॥

50. Thus, having spoken to Arjuna in that manner, Vāsudeva showed His own form again. And He, the exalted One, reassured this terrified one by again becoming serene in form.

## द ृ वेदं मानुषं पं तव सौयं जनादन। इदानीमिम संवृ : सचेता: कृ ितं गत:॥५१॥

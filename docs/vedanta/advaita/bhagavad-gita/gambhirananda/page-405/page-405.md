of Bhagavān spoken of in, 'Māyā of Mine ... difficult to cross' (7.14). The word *eva* (itself) is used for singling out Prakrti (Nature). The Prakrti divided eightfold [\(94\)](#page--1-0) is this much alone. The word *ca* (and) is used for joining the various categories.

The *daśa*, ten; *indriyāni*, organs : The five organs, ear etc., which are called sense-organs since they produce perception, and the (other) five organs—organ of speech, hands, etc.—which are called motor-organs since they accomplish actions. They are ten. *Ekam ca*, and the one—which is that?—the mind, the eleventh, possessed of the power of thinking etc. (see fn. on p. 144). *Ca*, and; the *pañca*, five; *indriya-gocarāh*, objects of the senses—such objects as sound etc. The followers of the Sānkhya call these which are such the twenty-four categories.

## इछा ेष: सुखं द: ु खं सातेतना धृित:। एतें समासेन सिवकारमुदाह ृ तम्॥६॥

6. Desire, repulsion, happiness, sorrow, the aggregate (of body and organs), sentience, fortitude—this field, together with its modifications, has been spoken of briefly.

*Icchā*, desire: Having experienced again an object of that kind which had given him the feeling of pleasure earlier, a man wants to have it under the idea that it is a source of pleasure. That is this desire which is an attribute of the internal organ, and is the 'field' since it is an object of knowledge.

So also *dvesah*, repulsion: Having experienced again an object of that kind which he had earlier felt as a cause of sorrow, he hates it. That is this repulsion, and it is surely the 'field' since it is an object of knowledge. Similarly, *sukham*, happiness—which is favourable, tranquil, having the quality of *sattva*—is the 'field' since it is an object

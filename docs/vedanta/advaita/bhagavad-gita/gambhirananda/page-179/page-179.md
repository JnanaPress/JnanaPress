*karmāni*, activities of the vital force—*prāna* means the air in the body; they offer its activities such as contraction, expansion, etc; *ātma-saṁyama Yog-agnau*, into the fire of the Yog of self-control withdrawal (*saṁyama*) [\(29\)](#page--1-0) into the Self (*ātmā*) is self-control (*ātmasaṁyama*); that itself is the fire of Yog (*Yog-agni*); (they offer) into that fire; *jñāna-dīpite*, which has been lighted by Knowledge, made to blaze up by discriminating knowledge, as if lighted up by oil.

*Tathā*, similarly; *apare*, others; are *dravya-yajñāh*, perfomers of sacrifices through wealth—those sacrificers who spend wealth (*dravya*) in holy places under the idea of performing sacrifices; *tapoyajñāh*, performers of sacrifices through austerity, men of austerity, to whom austerity is a sacrifice; [\(30\)](#page--1-1) *Yog-yajñāh*, performers of sacrifice through Yog—those to whom the Yog consisting in the control of the vital forces, withdrawal of the organs, etc., is a sacrifice; and *svādhyāya-jñāna-yajñāh*, performers of sacrifices through study and knowledge.

Sacrificers through study are those to whom the study of rg-veda etc. according to rules is a sacrifice. And sacrificers through knowledge are those to whom proper understanding of the meaning of the scriptures is a sacrifice. Others are *yatayah*, ascetics, who are diligent; *saṁśita-vratāh*, in following severe vows. Those whose vows (*vratāh*) have been fully sharpened (*samśita*), made very rigid, are *saṁśita-vratāh*.

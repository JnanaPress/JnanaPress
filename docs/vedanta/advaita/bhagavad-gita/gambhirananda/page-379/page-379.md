12 Knowledge is surely superior to practice; meditation surpasses knowledge. The renunciation of the results of works (excels) meditation. From renunciation, Peace follows immediately.

*Jñānam*, knowledge; [\(71\)](#page--1-0) is *hi*, surely; *śreyah*, superior; —to what?—*abhyāsāt*, to practice [\(72\)](#page--1-1) which is not preceded by discrimination. *Dhyānam*, meditation, undertaken along with knowledge; *viśisyate*, surpasses even *jñānāt*, that knowledge. *Karma-phala-tyāgah*, renunciation of the results of works; excels even *dhyānāt*, meditation associated with knowledge. ('Excels' has to be supplied.) *Tyāgāt*, from this renunciation of the results of actions, in the way described before; [\(73\)](#page--1-2) *śāntih*, Peace, the cessation of transmigratory existence together with its cause; follows *anantaram*, immediately; not that it awaits another occasion.

Should the unenlightened person engaged in works be unable to practise the disciplines enjoined earlier, then, for him has been enjoined renunciation of the results of all works as a means to Liberation. But this has not been done at the very beginning. And for this reason renunciation of the results of all works has been praised in, 'Knowledge is surely superior to practice,' etc. by teaching about the successive excellence. For it has been taught as being fit to be adopted by one in case he is unable to practise the disciplines already presented. [\(74\)](#page--1-3)

*Objection*: From what similarity does the eulogy follow?

*Reply*: In the verse, 'When all desires clinging to one's heart fall off' (Ka, 2.3.14), it has been stated that Immortality results from the rejection of all desires. That is well known. And 'all desires' means the 'result of all rites and duties enjoined in the Vedas and Smrtis'. From the renunciation of these, Peace surely comes immediately to the enlightened man who is steadfast in Knowledge.

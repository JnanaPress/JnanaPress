Here [\(62\)](#page--1-0) it has been said that, from the standpoint of the supreme Reality, there is no occasion for sorrow or delusion. (This is so) not merely from the standpoint of the supreme Reality, but—

## वधममिप चावे य न िवकिपतुमहिस। धयि युाेयोऽयियय न िवते॥३१॥

31. Even considering your own duty you should not waver, since there is nothing else better for a Ksatriya than a righteous battle.

*Api*, even; *aveksya*, considering; *svadharmam*, your own duty, the duty of a Ksatriya, namely battle—considering even that—; *na arhasi*, you ought not; *vikampitum*, to waver, to deviate from the natural duty of the Ksatriya, that is, from what is natural to yourself. And *hi*, since that battle is not devoid of righteousness, (but) is supremely righteous—it being conducive to virtue and meant for protection of subjects through conquest of the earth—; therefore, *na vidyate*, there is nothing; *anyat*, else; *śreyah*, better; *ksatriyasya*, for a Ksatriya; than that *dharmyāt*, righteous; *yuddhāt*, battle.

## यद ृ छया चोपपं वगारमपावृतम्। सुिखन: िया: पाथ लभते युमीदश ृ म्॥३२॥

32. O son of Prthā, happy are the Ksatriyas who come across this kind of a battle, which presents itself unsought for and which is an open gate to heaven.

Why, again, does that battle become a duty? This is being answered (as follows) [\(63\)](#page--1-1): *Pārtha*, O son of Prthā; are not those Ksatiryas *sukhinah*, happy; [\(64\)](#page--1-2) who *labhante*, come across; a *yuddham*, battle; *īdrśam*, of this kind; *upapannam*, which presents itself; *yadrcchayā*, unsought for; and which is an *apāvrtam*, open; *svarga-dvāram*, gate to heaven? [\(65\)](#page--1-3)

## अथ चेविममं धयं संामं न किरयिस। तत: वधमं कीितं च िहवा पापमवायिस॥३३॥

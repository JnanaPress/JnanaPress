O Dhanañjaya, *śrnu*, listen; *bhedam*, to the classification; *buddheh*, of the intellect; *ca eva*, as also; the classification *dhrteh*, of fortitude; *trividham*, which is threefold; *gunatah*, according to the *gunas*, *sattva* etc.—this much is an aphoristic statement—; *procyamānam*, while it is being stated; *aśesena*, elaborately, just as it is, without omitting anything; and *prthaktvena*, severally.

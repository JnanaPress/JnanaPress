Ye *bhaktāh*, those devotees who, seeking no other refuge; *evam*, thus; *satata-yuktāh*, being ever-devoted, that is, remaining unceasingly engaged in the works of the Bhagavān, etc., intent on the aforesaid purpose; *paryupāsate*, meditate; *tvām*, on You, in the Cosmic form as revealed earlier; *ye ca api*, and those others, again, who have renounced all desires, who have given up all actions; who meditate on Brahman as described (below), *aksaram*, on the Immutable; *avyaktam*, on the Unmanifested, which is so on account of being bereft of all limiting adjuncts, (and) which is beyond the comprehension of the organs—in the world, whatever comes within the range of the organs is said to be manifest, for the root *añj* conveys that sense; but this Immutable is the opposite of that and is endowed with qualifications that are spoken of by the great ones; those again, who meditate on that—; *tesām*, of them, among the two (groups); *ke*, who; are the *Yog-vit-tamāh*, best experiencers of Yog, that is, who are those that are surpassingly versed in Yog?

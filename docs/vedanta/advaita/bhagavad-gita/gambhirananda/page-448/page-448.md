7. Know *rajas* to be of the nature of passion, born of hankering and attachment. O son of Kuntī, that binds the embodied one through attachment to action.

*Viddhi*, know; *rajas* to be *rāgātmakam*, of the nature of passion (—*rāga* is derived in the sense of that which colours—), having the property of colouring, like the ochre pigment etc.; *trsnā-āsangasamud-bhavam*, born of hankering and attachment—hankering is the longing for things not acquired; attachment is the clinging—of the nature of fondness—of the mind to things in possession. O son of Kuntī, *tat*, that, that *rajas*; *nibadhnāti*, binds; *dehinam*, the embodied one; *karma-sangena*, through attachment to actions.

O scion of the Bharata dynasty, *tat*, that *tamas*; *nibadhnāti*, binds; *pramāda-ālasyanidrābhih*, through inadvertence, laziness and sleep.

The activities of the qualities are again being briefly stated:

## सवं सुखे सयित रज: कमिण भारत। ानमावृ य तु तम: मादे सययुत॥९॥

9. O scion of the Bharata dynasty, *sattva* attaches one to happiness, *rajas* to action, while *tamas*, covering up knowledge, leads to inadvertence also.

O scion of the Bharata dynasty, *sattva*, *Sanjayati*, attaches one; *sukhe*, to happiness; *rajas* (—*attaches* is understood—) *karmani*, to

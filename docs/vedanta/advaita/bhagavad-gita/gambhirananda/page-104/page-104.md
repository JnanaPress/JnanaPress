The process is elsewhere described as follows:

बुितथिचदाभासौ ाविप याुतो घटम् । ताान िधया नय ं ेदाभासेन घट: फु रेत्॥ (P.7.91)

The *vrtti* goes out through the sense-organ concerned, like the flash of a torchlight, and along with it goes the reflection of Consciousness. Both of them envelop the object, a pot for instance. The *vrtti* destroys the ignorance about the pot; and the reflection of Consciousness, becoming unified with only that portion of it which has been delimited by the pot, reveals the pot.

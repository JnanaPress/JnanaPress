remembering that the organs function in relation to the objects of the organs.

*Yuktah*, remaining absorbed in the Self; *tattva-vit*, the knower of Reality—knower of the real nature of Truth, of the Self, that is, the seer of the supreme Reality; *manyeta*, should think; '*na karomi eva*, I certainly do not do; *kiñcit*, anything.'

Having realized the Truth, when or how should he think?

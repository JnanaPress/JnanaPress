which is desired for', viz. sound etc.; considering their enjoyment to be the highest; having their minds convinced thus that this alone, viz. the enjoyment of desirable objects, is the highest human goal; *niścitah*, feeling sure; *iti*, that; *etāvat*, this is all—

## आशापाशशतैबा: कामोधपरायणा:। ईहते कामभोगाथमयायेनाथसचयान्॥१२॥

12. Bound by hundreds of shackles in the form of hope, giving themselves wholly to passion and anger, they endeavour to amass wealth through foul means for the enjoyment of desirable objects.

*Baddhāh*, bound, being impelled, being lured from all sides; *āśāpāśa-śataih*, by hundreds of shackles in the from of hope—the hopes themselves are the shackles; by hundreds of these; *kāma-krodhaparāyanāh*, giving themselves wholly to passion and anger, having passion and anger as their highest resort; *īhante*, they endeavour; *artha-sañcayān*, to amass wealth; *anyāyena*, through foul means, that is by stealing others' wealth, etc.; *kāma-bhoga-artham*, for the enjoyment of desirable objects—in order to enjoy desirable objects, not for righteous acts.

Their intentions, too, are of this kind:

## इदम मया लदिमदं ाये मनोरथम्। इदमतीदमिप मे भिवयित पुनधनम्॥१३॥

13. 'This has been gained by me today; I shall acquire this desired object. This is in hand; again, this wealth also will come to me.'

*Idam*, this thing; *labdham*, has been gained; *mayā*, by me; *adya*, today; *prāpsye*, I shall acquire; *idam*, this other; *manoratham*, desired object which is delectable to the mind. And *idam*, this; *asti*, is in hand; *punah*, again; *idam*, this; *dhanam*, wealth; *api*, also; *bhavisyati*, will come; *me*, to me, in the next year. Thereby I shall become rich and famous.

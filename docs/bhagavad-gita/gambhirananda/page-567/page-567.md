63. To you has been imparted by Me this knowledge [\(251\)](#page--1-0) which is more secret than any secret. Pondering over this as a whole, do as you like.

*Te*, to you; *ākhyātam*, has been imparted, spoken of; *mayā*, by Me who am the omniscient Bhagavān; *iti*, this; *jñānam*, knowledge; which is *guhyataram*, more secret; *guhyāt*, than any secret—i.e. it is extremely profound, mystical. *Vimrśya*, pondering over, contemplating on; *etat*, this, the Scripture as imparted; *aśesena*, as a whole, and also on all the subjects dealt with; *kuru*, do; *yathā icchasi tathā*, as you like.

*Śrnu*, listen; *bhūyah*, again; to *me*, My; *paramam*, highest; *vacah*, utterance; which is *sarva-guhyatamam*, profoundest of all, most secret of all secrets, though it has been repeatedly stated. Neither from fear nor even for the sake of money am I speaking! What then? *Iti*, since, considering that; *asi*, you are; *drḍham*, ever, unwaveringly; *isṭah*, dear; *me*, to Me; *tatah*, therefore, for that reason; *vaksyāmi*, I shall speak; what is *hitam*, beneficial; *te*, to you, what is the highest means of attaining Knowledge. That is indeed the most beneficial of all beneficial things.

'What is that (You are going to tell me)?' In answer the Bhagavān says:

## ममना भव मतो माजी म नमकु । मामेवैयिस सयं ते ितजाने ियोऽिस मे॥६५॥

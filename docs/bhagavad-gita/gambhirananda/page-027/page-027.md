24–5. O scion of the line of Bharata (Dhritarashtra), Hrsīkeśa, on being told so by Guḍākeśa (Arjuna), placed the excellent chariot between the two armies, in front of Bhishma and Drona as also all the rulers of the earth, and said, 'O Pārtha (Arjuna), see these assembled people of the Kuru [\(19\)](#page--1-0) dynasty.' [\(20\)](#page--1-1)

## तापयत् िथतान् पाथ िपतृनथ िपतामहान्। आचायन् मातुलान् ातृन् पुान् पौान् सखॴतथा। शुरान् सुह ृ दैव सेनयोभयोरिप॥२६॥

26. Then Pārtha (Arjuna) saw, marshalled among both the armies, (his) uncles as also grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers (and cousins), sons, grandsons, as well as comrades and fathers-in-law and friends.

## तान् समीय स कौतेय: सवबधूनविथतान्। कृ पया परयािवो िवषीदिदमवीत्॥२७॥

27. The son of Kuntī (Arjuna), seeing all those relatives arrayed (there), became overwhelmed by supreme compassion and said this sorrowfully:

*Arjuna said:*

## द ृ वेमं वजनं कृ ण युयु सुं समुपिथतम्। सीदित मम गाािण मुखं च पिरशु यित॥२८॥

28. O Krishna, seeing these relatives and friends who have assembled here with the intention of fighting, my limbs become languid and my mouth becomes completely dry. [\(21\)](#page--1-2)

## वेपथु शरीरे मे रोमहष जायते। गाडीवं सं ते हतावक् चैव पिरदते॥२९॥

ो

29. And there is trembling in my body, and there is horripillation; the Gānḍīva (bow) slips from the hand and even the skin burns intensely. [\(22\)](#page--1-3)

*Shri Hari said:*

## असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दि ु नहं चलम्। अयासेन तु कौतेय वैरायेण च गृते॥३५॥

35. O mighty-armed one, undoubtedly the mind is untractable and restless. But, O son of Kuntī, it is brought under control through practice and detachment.

*Mahābāho*, O mighty-armed one; *asaṁśayam*, undoubtedly there is no doubt with regard to this; that the *manah*, mind; is *durnigraham*, untractable; and *calam*, restless. *Tu*, but; it—the modifications of the mind in the form of distractions—*grhyate*, is brought under control; *abhyāsena*, through practice—*abhyāsa* means repetition of some idea or thought of the mind on some mental plane [\(85\)](#page--1-0)—; and *vairāgyena*, through detachment—*vairāgya* means absence of hankering for enjoyment of desirable things, seen or unseen, as a result of the practice of discerning their defects.

That mind is thus brought under control, restrained, that is completely subdued.

## असंयतामना योगो द ु ाप इित मे मित:। वयामना तु यतता शयोऽवातुमुपायत:॥३६॥

36. My conviction is that Yog is difficult to be attained by one of uncontrolled mind. But it is possible to be attained through the (above) means by one who strives and has a controlled mind.

*Me*, My; *matih*, conviction; is *iti*, that; Yog is *dusprāpah*, difficult to be attained; *asaṁyata-ātmanā*, by one of uncontrolled mind, by one who has not controlled his mind, the internal organ, by practice and detachment. *Tu*, but, on the other hand; *śakyah*, Yog is possible; *avāptum*, to be attained; *yatatā*, by one who strives, who repeatedly makes effort; *upāyatah*, through the means described above; and

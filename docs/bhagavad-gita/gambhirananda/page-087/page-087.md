## यदा संहरते चायं कू मऽानीव सवश:। इियाणीियाथयतय ा ितिता॥५८॥

58. And when this one fully withdraws the senses from the objects of the senses, as a tortoise wholly (withdraws) the limbs, then his wisdom remains established.

And besides, *yadā*, when; *ayam*, this one, the *sannyāsin* practising steadfastness in Knowledge; *saṁharate*, fully withdraws; [\(96\)](#page--1-0) *indriyāni*, the senses; *indriya-arthebhyah*, from all the objects of the senses; *iva*, as; *kūrmah*, a tortoise; *sarvaśah*, wholly (withdraws); *angāni*, its limbs, from all sides out of fear;—when the man engaged in steadfastness to Knowledge withdraws thus, then *tasya*, his; *prajñā*, wisdom; *pratisṭhitā*, remains established—(the meaning of this portion has already been explained).

The word *rasa* is well known as referring to the sense of taste (hankering), as in such expressions as, '*sva-rasena pravrttah*, induced by his own taste (that is, willingly)', '*rasikah*, a man of tastes', '*rasajñah*, a connoisseur (of

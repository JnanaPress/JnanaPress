*Those for whom*: Enjoyment becomes complete when shared with one's dear friends and relatives. But, if they are all killed, securing enjoyments becomes pointless.—Tr.

*Pleasures*: Since *enjoyment* itself implies pleasure, the use of the word *pleasure* again, stands for the *means* of pleasure.

*Risking*: The literal translation should have been, 'giving up their lives and wealth'; but this is not factually correct. They were only risking their wealth and lives.—Tr.

[[26](#page--1-0)] *Want*: 'I do not even wish to kill, what to speak of actually doing so!'

*Madhusudan*: By using this name Arjuna meant that, He, being the founder of the Vedic Path, should not urge Arjuna to undertake an un-Vedic war.

[[27](#page--1-1)] *Janārdana*: Literally, one who afflicts creatures. By addressing Krishna thus, Arjuna hinted that, since killing of relatives was sinful in his case, therefore, if they are to be killed at all, it should be done by Krishna Himself, for no sin accrues to Him even when He destroys the whole world at the time of cosmic dissolution.

*Felon*, *ātatāyin*: He is one who sets fire to the house of, administers poison to, falls upon with a sword on, steals the wealth, land and wife of, another person:

Cf. *Agnido garadaścaiva śastra-pānir-dhanāpahah*

*Ksetra-dārāpahārī ca saḍete ātatāyinah.*

Duryodhana and his accomplices had committed all these atrocities against the Pandavas, and it would not have been sinful to kill them. But Arjuna argues that though this is valid, still they were relatives, and killing of relatives is a sinful act.

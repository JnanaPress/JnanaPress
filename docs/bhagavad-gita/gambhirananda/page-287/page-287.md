## य काले वनावृिमावृिं चैव योिगन:। याता याित तं कालं वयािम भरतषभ॥२३॥

23. O best of the Bharata dynasty, I shall now speak of that time by departing at which the yogīs attain the State of Non-return, and also (of the time by departing at which they attain) the State of Return.

*Bharatarsabha*, O best of the Bharata dynasty; *vaksyāmi*, I shall speak; *tu*, now; *tam*, of that; *kālam*, time; *prayātāh*, by departing, by dying; (—these words are to be connected with the remote words) *yatra kāle*, at which time; *yoginah*, the yogīs; *yānti*, attain; *anāvrttim*, the State of Non-return, of non-rebirth; *ca eva*, and also; of the time by departing at which they attain its opposite, *āvrttim*, the State of Return.

By 'yogīs' are implied both the yogīs (men of meditation) and the men of actions (rites and duties). But the men of action are yogīs by courtesy, in accordance with the description, 'through the Yog of Action for the yogīs' (3.3).

The Bhagavān speaks of that time: [\(122\)](#page--1-0)

## अिनयितरह: शुल: षमासा उरायणम्। त याता गछित िवदो जना:॥२४॥

24. Fire, light, daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of the Northern solstice—by following this Path, persons who are knowers of Brahman attain Brahman when they die.

*Agnih*, fire—is a deity presiding over a period of time; similarly, *jyotih*, light—also is a deity presiding over a period of time. Or fire and light are the well-known Vedic deities.

As the expression 'mango grove' is used with regard to a place where mango trees are more numerous, similarly, the expressions 'at which time' and 'that time' (in the earlier verse) are used in view of the predominance (of the deities presiding over time). [\(123\)](#page--1-1)

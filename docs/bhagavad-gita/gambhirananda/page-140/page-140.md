## काम एष ोध एष रजोगुणसमुव:। महाशनो महापामा िवयेनिमह वैिरणम्॥३७॥

37. This desire, this anger, born of the quality of *rajas*, is a great devourer, a great sinner. Know this to be the enemy here.

*Esāh*, this; *kāmah*, desire, is the enemy of the whole world, because of which the creatures incur all evil. This desire when obstructed in any way turns into anger. Therefore, *krodhah*, anger, is also identical with this (desire). It is *rajoguna-samudbhavah*, born of the quality of *rajas*; or, it is the origin of the quality of *rajas*. For, when desire comes into being, it instigates a person by arousing *rajas*. People who are engaged in service etc., which are effects of rajas, and who are stricken with sorrow are heard to lament, 'I have been led to act by desire indeed!' It is *mahā-aśanah*, a great devourer, whose food is enormous. And hence, indeed, it is *mahā-pāpmā*, a great sinner. For a being commits sin when goaded by desire. Therefore, *viddhi*, know; *enam*, this desire; to be *vairinam*, the enemy; *iha*, here in this world.

With the help of examples the Bhagavān explains how it is an enemy:

## धूमेनािवयते वियथाऽदश मलेन च। यथोबेनावृतो गभतथा तेनदे मावृतम्॥३८॥

38. As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dirt, and as a foetus remains enclosed in the womb, so is this shrouded by that.

*Yathā*, as; *vahnih*, fire, which is naturally bright; *āvriyate*, is enveloped; *dhūmena*, by smoke, which is born concomitantly (with fire) and is naturally dark; or as *ādarśah*, a mirror; is covered *malena*, by dirt; *ca*, and; *garbhah*, a foetus; is *āvrtah*, enclosed; *ulbena*, in the womb by the amnion; *tathā*, so; is *idam*, this; *āvrtam*, shrouded; *tena*, by that.

Again, what is that which is indicated by the word *idam* (this), and which is covered by desire? The answer is:

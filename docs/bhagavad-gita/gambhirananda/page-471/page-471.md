*Acetasah*, the non-discriminating ones; *akrta-ātmānah*, who lack self-control, who have not purified themselves through austerity and control of the organs, who have not desisted from bad conduct, who are not tranquil and are proud by nature; *na*, do not; *paśyanti*, see; *enam*, this one; *api*, though; (they be) *yatantah*, diligent—even though they be striving with the help of the valid means of knowledge such as the scriptures.

With a view to speaking of the all-pervasiveness of the State and the fact of Its being the substratum of all empirical dealings, the Bhagavān speaks in brief through the following four verses of the divine manifestations of that State which the light of fire, sun, etc. do not illumine though they are the illuminators of everything; and reaching which the aspirants of Liberation do not return again towards mundane existence; and of which State the individual Ātman(s), owing to their conformity with the diversity of limiting adjuncts, are parts, just as spaces enclosed in pot etc. are 'parts' of Space:

## यदािदयगतं तेजो जगासयते ऽिखलम्। यचमिस यचानौ तेजो िवि मामकम्॥१२॥

12. That light in the sun which illumines the whole world, that which is in the moon, and that which is in fire,—know that light to be Mine.

*Yat*, that which is; *āditya-gatam*, in the sun, which abides in the sun;—what is that—the *tejah*, light, brilliance, radiance; which *bhāsayate*, illumines, reveals; *akhilam*, the whole, entire; *jagat*, world; *yat*, that illuminating light which is; *candramasi*, in the moon; *ca*, and *yat*, which is; *agnau*, in fire, the carrier of oblations; *viddhi*, know; *tat*, that; *tejah*, light; to be *māmakam*, Mine. That light belong to Me who am Visnu.

Or: The light that is Consciousness, which is in the sun, which is in the moon, and which is in fire, know that light to be Mine. That light belongs to Me who am Visnu.

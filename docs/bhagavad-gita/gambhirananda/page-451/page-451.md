## यदा सवे वृे तु लयं याित देहभृत्। तदोमिवद लोकानमलाितपते॥१४॥

14. When an embodied one undergoes death while *sattva* is exclusively predominant, then he attains the taintless worlds of those who know the highest (entities).

*Yadā*, when; *deha-bhrt*, an embodied one, the Ātman; *yāti*, undergoes; *pralayam*, death; *sattve pravrddhe*, while *sattva* is predominant; *tu*, exclusively; [\(142\)](#page--1-0) *tadā*, then; *pratipadyate*, he attains, that is gains; the *amalān*, taintless, stainless; *lokān*, worlds; [\(143\)](#page--1-1) *uttamavidām*, of those who know the highest, that is of those who have known the principles—*mahat* and the rest.

## रजिस लयं गवा कमसिषु जायते। तथा लीनतमिस मूढयोिनषु जायते॥१५॥

15. When one dies while *rajas* predominates, he is born among people attached to activity. Similarly, when one dies while *tamas* predominates, he takes birth among the stupid species.

*Pralayam gatvā*, when one dies; *rajasi*, while the quality of *rajas* predominates; *jāyate*, he is born; *karma-sangisu*, among people attached to activity, among human beings having attachment to work. *Tathā*, similarly, in that very way; *pralīnah*, when one dies; *tamasi*, while *tamas* predominates; *jāyate*, he takes birth; *mūḍhayonisu*, among the stupid species, such as animals etc.

A summary of the idea of the preceding (three) verses is being stated:

## कमण: सुकृ तयाह: ु सािवकं िनमलं फलम्। रजसतु फलं द: ु खमानं तमस: फलम्॥१६॥

16. They say that the result of good work is pure and is born of *sattva*. But the result of *rajas* is sorrow; the result of *tamas* is ignorance.

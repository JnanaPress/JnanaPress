4. The which exists in the physical plane is the mutable entity, and what exists in the divine plane is the Person. O best among the embodied beings, I Myself am the entity that exists in the sacrifice in this body.

*Purusah* means the Person, derived in the sense of he by whom all things are pervaded; or, he who lies in every heart. He is Hiranyagarbha, who resides in the Sun and sustains the organs of all creatures. He is *adhi-daivatam*, the entity existing in the divine plane.

Since a sacrifice is performed with body, therefore it is closely associated with the body. In this sense it is said to be going on in the body.

*Ca*, and; *anta-kāle*, at the time of death; *yah*, anyone who; *prayāti*, departs; *muktvā*, by giving up; the *kalevaram*, body; *smaran*, while thinking; *mām eva*, of Me alone, who am the supreme Bhagavān Visnu; *sah*, he; *yāti*, attains; *madbhāvam*, My state, the

## नातं न मयं न पुनतवािदं पयािम िवेर िवप॥१६॥

16. I see You as possessed of numerous arms, bellies, mouths and eyes; as having infinite forms all around. O Bhagavān of the Universe, O Cosmic Person, I see not Your limit nor the middle, nor again the beginning!

_Paśyāmi_, I see; _tvām_, You; _aneka-bāhu-udara-vaktra-netram_, as possessed of numerous arms, bellies, mouths and eyes; _anantarūpam_, having infinite forms; _sarvatah_, all around. _Viśveśwara_, O Bhagavān of the Universe; _viśva-rūpa_, O Cosmic Person; _na paśyāmi_, I see not; [\(44\)](#page--1-0) _tava_, Your; _antam_, end; _na madhyam_, nor the middle—what lies between two extremities; _na punah_, nor again; the _ādim_, beginning—I see not the limit (end) nor the middle, nor again the beginning, of You who are Bhagavān!

17. I see You as wearing a diadem, wielding a mace, and holding a disc; a mass of brilliance glowing all around, difficult to look at from all sides, possessed of the radiance of the blazing fire and sun, and immeasurable.

_Paśyāmi_, I see; _tvām_, You; as _kirīṭinam_, wearing a diadem—_kirīṭa_ is a kind of decoration for the head; one having it is _kirīṭī_; _gadinam_, wielding a mace; and also _cakrinam_, holding a disc; _tejorāśim_, a mass of brilliance; _sarvatah dīptimantam_, glowing all around; _durnirīksyam_, difficult to look at; _samantāt_, from all sides, at every point; as though _dīpta-anala-arka-dyutim_, possessed of the radiance (_dyuti_) of the blazing (_dīpta_) fire (_anala_) and sun (_arka_); and _aprameyam_, immeasurable, that is beyond limitation.

3. Among thousands of men a rare one endeavours for perfection. Even of the perfected ones who are diligent, one perchance knows Me in truth.

*Sahasresu manusyānām*, among thousands, among a multitude of men; *kaścit*, a rare one; *yatati*, endeavours; *siddhaye*, for perfection. [\(93\)](#page--1-0) *Siddhānām api*, even of the perfected ones; *yatatām*, who are diligent—they (those diligent ones themselves) being (considered to be) verily perfect because they are striving for Liberation; of them—; *kaścit*, one perchance, indeed; *vetti*, knows; *mām*, Me; *tattvatah*, in truth.

Having drawn the attention of the hearer by arousing interest, the Bhagavān says:

## भूिमरापोऽनलो वायु: खं मनो बुिरेव च। अहकार ं इतीयं मे िभा कृ ितरधा॥४॥

4. This Prakrti of Mine is divided eight-fold thus: earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intellect and also egoism.

*Iyam*, this; *prakrtih*, Prakrti, [\(94\)](#page--1-1) the divine power called Māyā; *me*, of Mine, as described; *bhinnā*, is divided; *asṭadhā*, eight-fold; *iti*, thus: *bhūmih*, earth—not the gross earth but the subtle element called earth, this being understood from the statement, 'Prakrti (of Mine) is divided eight-fold'. Similarly, the subtle elements alone are referred to even by the words *water* etc.

*Apah*, water; *analah*, fire; *vāyuh*, air; *kham*, space; *manah*, mind. By 'mind' is meant its source, egoism. By *buddhih*, intellect, is meant the principle called *mahat [\(95\)](#page--1-2)* which is the source of egoism. By *ahankārah*, egoism, is meant the Unmanifest, associated [\(96\)](#page--1-3) with (Cosmic) ignorance. As food mixed with poison is called poison, similarly the Unmainfest, which is the primordial Cause, is called egoism since it is imbued with the impressions resulting from egoism; and egoism is the impelling force (of all). It is indeed seen in the world that egoism is the impelling cause behind all endeavour.

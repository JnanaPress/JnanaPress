*Pratisṭhāpya*, having established; *sthiram*, firmly; *śucau*, in a clean; *deśe*, place, which is solitary, either naturally or through improvement; *ātmanah*, his own; *āsanam*, seat; *na ati ucchritam*, neither too high; *na ati nīcam*, nor even too low; and that made of *caila-ajina-kuśa-uttram*, cloth, skin, and *kuśa*-grass, placed successively one below the other—the successive arrangement of cloth etc. here is in a reverse order to that of the textual reading—.

What follows after thus establishing the seat?

*Upaviśya*, sitting; *tatra*, on that; *āsane*, seat; *Yogm yuñjyāt*, he should concentrate his mind. To what purpose should he concentrate his mind?

14. He should remain seated with a placid mind, free from fear, firm in the vow of a celibate, and with the mind fixed on Me by controlling it through concentration, having Me as the supreme Goal.

*Dhārayan*, holding; *kāya-śiro-grīvam*, the body (torso), head and neck; *samam*, erect; and *acalam*, still—movement is possible for one (even while) holding these erect; therefore it is specified, 'still'—; *sthirah*, being steady, that is remaining steady; *sampreksya*, looking *svam nāsikāgram*, at the tip of his own nose—looking at it intently, as

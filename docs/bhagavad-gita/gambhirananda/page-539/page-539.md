32. O Pārtha, that intellect is born of *tamas* which, being covered by darkness, considers vice as virtue, and verily perceives all things contrary to what they are.

O Pārtha, *sā*, that; *buddhih*, intellect; *tāmasī*, is born of *tamas*; *yā*, which; *tamasāvrtā*, being covered by darkness; *manyate*, considers, understands; *adharmam*, vice, what is prohibited; *iti*, as; *dharmam*, virtue, what is prescribed; and *ca*, verily; perceives *sarva-arthān*, all things, all objects of knowledge without exception; *viparītān*, contrary to what they are.

Bhagavān of all beings, the great Bhagavān of all beings who is their Self; *mūḍhāh*, foolish people, the non-discriminating ones; *avajānanti*, disregard, belittle; *mām*, Me, although I am by nature thus eternal, pure, intelligent, free and the Self of all beings; and *āśritam*, who have taken; *mānusīm tanum*, a human body common to men, that is, when I act with the help of a human body. As a result of that, as a result of continuously disrespecting Me, those wretches get ruined.

## मोघाशा मोघकमणो मोघाना िवचेतस:। रासीमासुरॴ चैव कृ ितं मोिहनॴ िता:॥१२॥

12. Of vain hopes, of vain actions, of vain knowledge, and senseless, they become verily possessed of the deceptive disposition of fiends and demons.

*Moghāśāh*, of vain hopes. So also, *mogha-karmānah*, of vain actions: their rites, such as Agnihotra etc. which are undertaken by them, verily become vain, fruitless actions, because of dishonouring the Bhagavān, disregarding Him who is their own Self. In this way they are of vain actions.

Similarly, *mogha-jñānāh*, of vain knowledge: of fruitless knowledge; even their knowledge verily becomes useless. And *vicetasah*, senseless: that is, they lose their power of discrimination. Besides, [\(141\)](#page--1-0) they become *śritāh*, possessed of; the *mohinīm*, selfdeceptive, self-delusive; *prakrtim*, disposition; *rāksasīm*, of fiends; and *āsurīm*, of demons—according to which the body is the Self; that is, they become habitually inclined to act cruelly, saying, 'cut, break, drink, eat, steal others' wealth,' etc. [\(142\)](#page--1-1) This is stated in the Śruti, 'Those worlds of devils (are covered by blinding darkness)' (Īś. 3).

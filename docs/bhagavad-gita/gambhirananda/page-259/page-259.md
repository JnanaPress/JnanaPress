## पु यो गध: पृिथय च तेजािम िवभावसौ। जीवनं सवभूतेषु तपािम तपिवषु॥९॥

9. I am also the sweet fragrance in the earth; I am the brilliance in the fire, and the life in all beings; and I am the austerity of the ascetics.

I am also the *punyah*, sweet; *gandhah*, fragrance; *prthivyām*, in the earth. The earth is dependent on Me who am its fragrance. The natural sweetness of smell in the earth is cited by way of suggesting sweetness of taste of water etc. as well. But foulness of smell etc. is due to contact with particular things, resulting from nescience, unholiness, etc. of worldly people.

*Ca*, and; *asmi*, I am; the *tejah*, brilliance; *vibhāvasau*, in fire; so also (I am) the *jīvanam*, life—that by which all creatures live; *sarvabhūtesu*, in all beings. And I am the *tapah*, austerity; *tapasvisu*, of ascetics. Ascetics are established in Me who am that austerity.

O Pārtha, *viddhi*, know, *mām*, Me; to be the *sanātanam*, eternal; *bījam*, seed, the source of growth; *sarva-bhūtānām*, of all beings. Besides, I am the *buddhih*, intellect, the power of discrimination of the mind; *buddhimatām*, of the intelligent, of people having the power of discrimination. I am the *tejah*, courage; *tejasvinām*, of the courageous, of those possessed of that.

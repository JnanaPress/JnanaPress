## *THE WAY OF RENUNCIATION OF ACTIONS*

## कमसंासयोगः

In the instructions beginning with 'He who finds inaction in action' (4.18), and in, 'he is engaged in Yog and is a performer, of all actions (ibid.), 'whose actions have been burnt away by the fire of wisdom' (ibid. 19), 'performing actions merely for the (maintenance of the) body' (ibid. 21), 'Remaining satisfied with what comes unasked for' (ibid. 22), 'The ladle is Brahman, the oblation is Brahman' (ibid. 24), 'Know them all to be born of action' (ibid. 32), 'O son of Prthā, all actions in their totality culminate in Knowledge' (ibid. 33), 'the fire of Knowledge reduces all actions to ashes' (ibid. 37), ending with 'actions do not bind one who has renounced actions through Yog' (ibid. 41), the Bhagavān spoke of renunciation of all actions.

The monasticism under discussion is called Brahman because it leads to knowledge of the supreme Self, as stated in the Upanisad, 'Nyāsa (monasticism) is Brahman. Brahman is verily the supreme' (Ma. Nā. 21.2) Brahman means monasticism in the real sense, consisting in steadfastness to the knowledge of the supreme Self.

That is to say, he does not become bound by actions.

And besides, this person does not act in the real sense. Hence,

नवै िकिचकरोमीित युतो मयेत तविवत्। पयछ ृ वपृशिगछवपसन्॥८॥ लपिवसृजगृ ुिमषििमषिप। इियाणीियाथषु वतत इित धारयन्॥९॥

8–9. Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, 'I certainly do not do anything', even while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, releasing, holding, opening and closing the eyes—

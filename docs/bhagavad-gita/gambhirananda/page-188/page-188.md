Since one whose doubts have been destroyed by Knowledge arising from the destruction of the impurities (of body, mind, etc.) as a result of the practice of Karma-Yog—does not get bound by actions owing to the mere fact of his actions having been burnt away by Knowledge; and since one who has doubts with regard to the practice of the Yogs of Knowledge and actions gets ruined—

## तमादानसभूतं ह ृ थं ानािसनामन:। िछवैनं संशयं योगमाितोि भारत॥४२॥

42. Therefore, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, take recourse to Yog and rise up, cutting asunder with the sword of Knowledge this doubt of your own in the heart, arising from ignorance.

*Tasmāt*, therefore, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; *ātisṭha*, take recourse to, that is undertake; *Yogm*, Yog—performance of actions, which is a means to full Illumination; and now, *uttisṭha*, rise up for battle; *chittvā*, cutting asunder; *jñānāsinā*, with the sword of Knowledge—Knowledge is full Illumination, which is a destroyer of such defects as sorrows, delusion, etc.; that itself is the sword; with that sword of Knowledge—; *enam*, this; *saṁśayam*, doubt; *ātmanah*, of your own, which is a source of one's own ruin and is most sinful; *hrtstham*, in the heart, residing in the intellect; *ajñāna-sambhūtam*, arising from ignorance, born of non-discrimination.

The word *ātmanah* is used because doubt concerns oneself. Indeed, another's doubt cannot be removed by someone else. Hence the word 'own' is used. So, although the doubt is with regard to the Self, it is really one's own.

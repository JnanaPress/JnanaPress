## अपरेयिमतवय कृ ितं िवि मे पराम्। जीवभूत महाबाहो ययेदं धायते जगत्॥५॥

5. O mighty-armed one, this is the inferior (Prakrti). Know the other Prakrti of Mine which, however, is higher than this, which has taken the from of individual Ātman(s), and by which this world is upheld.

O mighty-armed one, *iyam*, this; is *aparā*, the inferior (Prakrti) not the higher, (but)—the impure, the source of evil and having the nature of worldly bondage. *Viddhi*, know; *anyām*, the other, pure; *prakrtim*, Prakrti; *me*, of Mine, which is essentially Myself; which, *tu*, however; is *parām*, higher, more exalted; *itah*, than this (Prakrti) already spoken of; *Jīva-bhūtām*, which has taken the form of the individual Ātman(s), which is characterized as 'the Knower of the body (field)', and which is the cause of sustenance of life; and *yayā*, by which Prakrti; *idam*, this; *jagat*, world; *dhāryate*, is upheld, by permeating it.

## एतोनीिन भूतािन सवणीयुपधारय। अहं कृ नय जगत: भव: लयतथा॥६॥

6. Understand thus that all things (sentient and insentient) have these as their source. I am the origin as also the end of the whole Universe.

*Upadhāraya*, understand; *iti*, thus; that *sarvāni*, all; *bhūtāni*, things; *etat-yonīni*, have these (*etat*) as their source (*yoni*)—things that have these lower and higher Prakrtis, characterized as the 'field' and the 'Knower of the field (body)', as their source are *etat-yonīni*. Since My two Prakrtis are the source, the cause of all things, therefore, *aham*, I; am the *prabhavah*, origin; *tathā*, as also; the *pralayah*, end, the termination; *krtsnasya*, of the whole; *jagatah*, Universe.

The meaning is this: I, who am the omniscient Bhagavān, am the source of the Universe through My two Prakrtis.

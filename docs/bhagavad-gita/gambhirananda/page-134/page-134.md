belief, 'This has to be done; and the result of this action is to be reaped by me'; *ajñānām*, of the ignorant, of the non-discriminating ones; *karma-sanginām*, who are attached to work. But what should he do? Himself *samācaran*, working, performing those very activities of the ignorant; *yuktah*, while remaining diligent; *josayet*, he should make them do; *sarva-karmāni*, all the duties.

How does an unillumined, ignorant person become attached to actions? In reply the Bhagavān says:

## कृ ते : ियमाणािन गुणै : कमिण सवश:। अहारिवमूढामा कतहिमित मयते॥२७॥

27. While actions are being done in every way by the *gunas* (qualities) of Nature, one who is deluded by egoism thinks thus: 'I am the doer.'

*Karmāni kriyamānāni*, while actions, secular and scriptural, are being done; *sarvaśah*, in ever way; *gunaih*, by the *gunas*, (that is) by the modifications in the form of body and organs; (born) *prakrteh*, of Nature—Nature, (otherwise known as) *Pradhāna*, [\(45\)](#page--1-0) being the state of equilibrium of the three qualities of *sattva*, *rajas* and *tamas*; *ahankāra-vimūḍha-ātmā*, one who is deluded by egoism; *manyate*, thinks; *iti*, thus; '*Aham kartā*, I am the doer.'

*Ahankāra* is self-identification with the aggregate of body and organs. He whose *ātmā*, mind, is *vimūḍham*, deluded in diverse ways, by that (*ahankāra*) is *ahankāra-vimūḍha-ātmā*. He who imagines the characteristics of the body and organs to be his own, who has self-identification with the body and the organs, and who, through ignorance, believes the activities to be his own—, he thinks, 'I am the doer of those diverse activities.'

## तविव ु महाबाहो गुणकमिवभागयो:। गुणा गुणेषु वतत इित मवा न सजते॥२८॥

28. But, O mighty-armed one, the one who is a knower of the facts about the varieties of the *gunas* (qualities) and actions does not

## सुददु शिमदं पं द ृ वानिस यमम। देवा अयय पय िनयं दशनकािण:॥५२॥

52. This form of Mine which you have seen is very difficult to see; even the gods are ever desirous of a vision of this form.

*Idam*, this; *rūpam*, form; *mama*, of Mine; *yat*, which; *drsṭavān asi*, you have seen; is *sudur-darśam*, very difficult to see. *Api*, even; the *devāh*, gods; are *nityam*, ever; *darśana-kānksinah*, desirous of a vision; *asya*, of this; *rūpasya*, form of Mine. The idea is that though they want to see, they have not seen in the way you have, nor will they see!

Why so?

## नाहं वेदैन तपसा न दानने न चेयया। शय एविंवधो ुं द ृ वानिस म यथा॥५३॥

53. Not through the Vedas, not by austerity, not by gifts, nor even by sacrifice can I be seen in this form as you have seen Me.

*Na vedaih*, not through the Vedas, not even through the four Vedas—rk, Yajus, Sāma and Atharvan; *na tapasā*, not by austerity, not by severe austerities like the Cāndrāyana; not *dānena*, by gifts, by gifts of cattle, land, gold, etc.; *na ca*, nor even; *ijyayā*, by sacrifices or worship; *śakyah aham*, can I; *drasṭum*, be seen *evaṁvidhah*, in this form, in the manner as was shown; *yathā*, as; *drsṭavān asi*, you have seen *mām*, Me.

'How again, can You be seen?' This is being answered:

## भया वनयया शय अहमेविंवधोऽजु न। ातुं ुं च तवेन वे ुं च परतप॥५४॥

54. But, O Arjuna, by single-minded devotion am I—in this form able to be known and seen in reality, and also be entered into, O destroyer of foes.

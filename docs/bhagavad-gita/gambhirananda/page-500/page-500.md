## आहारा राजसया द: ु खशोकामयदा:॥९॥

9. Foods that are bitter, sour, salty, very hot, pungent, dry and burning, and which produce pain, sorrow and disease, are dear to one having *rajas*.

Foods that are *kaṭu-amla-lavana-atyusna-tīksna-rūksa-vidāhinah*, bitter, sour, salty, very hot (—'very' is to be connected with all, viz. bitter etc.; that is very bitter, very sour, etc.—), pungent, dry [\(185\)](#page--1-0) and burning; and *duhkha-śoka-āmaya-pradāh*, which produce pain, sorrow and disease; [\(186\)](#page--1-1) are *rājasasyaisṭāh*, dear to one having *rajas*.

## यातयामं गतरसं पूित पयु िषतं च यत्। उिछमिप चामेयं भोजनं तामसियम्॥१०॥

10. Food which is not properly cooked, lacking in essence, putrid and stale, and even ort and that which is unfit for sacrifice, is dear to one possessed of *tamas*.

*Bhojanam*, food; which is *yāta-yāmam*, not properly cooked [\(187\)](#page--1-2) (—because food that has lost its essence is referred to by the word *gatarasam*—); *gata-rasam*, lacking in essence; *pūti*, putrid; and *paryusitam*, stale, cooked on the previous day and kept overnight; and even *ucchisṭam*, ort, remnants of a meal; and *amedhyam*, that which is unfit for sacrifice;—this kind of food is *tāmasa-priyam*, dear to one possessed of *tamas*.

Now then, sacrifices of three kinds are being stated:

## अफलाकििभयो िविधद ृ ो य इयते। ययमेवेित मन: समाधाय स सािवक:॥११॥

11. That sacrifice which is in accordance with the injunctions, (and is) performed by persons who do not hanker after results, and with the mental conviction that it is surely obligatory, is done through *sattva*.

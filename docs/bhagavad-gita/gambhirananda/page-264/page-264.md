Why is this so? In answer the Bhagavān says: *Tu* but; *jñānī*, the man of Knowledge; is *ātmā eva*, the very Self, not different from Me. This is me, My; *matam*, opinion, conviction. *Hi*, for; *yuktātmā*, with a steadfast mind—having his mind absorbed in the idea, 'I am verily Vāsudeva, the Bhagavān, and none else', that man of Knowledge *āsthitah*, is set on the path leading to, he is engaged in ascending to, going to; *mām eva*, Me alone, to the supreme Brahman; who am the *anuttamām gatim*, super-excellent Goal to be reached.

The man of Knowledge is being eulogized again:

## बह ू न जमनामते ानवाम पते। वासुदेव: सविमित स महामा सुदल ु भ:॥१९॥

19. At the end of many births the man of Knowledge attains Me, (realizing) that Vāsudeva is all. Such a high-Ātmaned one is very rare.

*Ante*, at the end, after the completion; *bahūnām*, of many; *janmanām*, births, which becme the repository for accumulating [\(103\)](#page--1-0) the tendencies leading to Knowledge; *jñānavān*, the man of Knowledge, who has got his Knowledge matured; directly *prapadyate*, attains; *mām*, Me, Vāsudeva, who am the inmost Self; (realizing)—in what way?—*iti*, that; Vāsudeva is *sarvam*, all. *Sah*, such a one, who realizes Me [\(104\)](#page--1-1) thus as the Self of all; is *mahātmā*, a high-Ātmaned one. There is none else who can equal or excel him. Therefore he is *su-durlabhah*, very rare among thousands of men, as it has been said (in verse 3).

The reason why one does not realize that all this is verily Vāsudeva, the Self, is being stated:

## कामैतैतैह ृ ताना: पते ऽयदेवता:। तं तं िनयममाथाय कृ या िनयता: वया॥२०॥

20. People, deprived of their wisdom by desires for various objects and guided by their own nature, resort to other deities following the relevant methods.

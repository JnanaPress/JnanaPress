own forms; the entire *viśvam*, Universe; *tatam*, is pervaded; *tvayā*, by You.

Further,

## वायुयमोऽिनवण: शशा: जापितवं िपतामह। नमो नमते ऽतु सहकृ व: पुन भूयोऽिप नमो नमते॥३९॥

39. You are Air, Death, Fire, the Bhagavān of the waters, the moon, the Bhagavān of the creatures, and the Great-grandfather. Salutations! Salutation be to You a thousand times; salutation to You again and again! Salutation!

You are *vāyuh*, Air; *yamah*, Death; and *agnih*, Fire; *varunah*, the Bhagavān of the waters; *śaśānkah*, the moon; *prajāpatih*, the Bhagavān of the creatures—Kaśyapa and others; [\(52\)](#page--1-0) and *prapitāmahah*, the Great-grandfather, i.e. the Father ever of Brahmā (Hiranyagarbha). *Namo*, salutations; *namah*, salutation; *astu*, be; *te*, to You; *sahasra-krtvah*, a thousand times. *Punah ca bhūyah api namo te*, salutation to You again and again; *namah*, salutation!

The suffix *krtvasuc* (after *sahasra*) indicates performance and repetition of the act of salutation a number of times. The words *punah ca bhūyah api* (again and again) indicate his own dissatisfaction [\(53\)](#page--1-1) owing to abundance of reverence and devotion.

So also,

## नम: पुरतादथ पृ तते नमोऽतु ते सवत एव सव। अनतवीयिमतिवमवं सवं समाोिष ततोऽिस सव :॥४०॥

40. Salutation to You in the East and behind. Salutation be to You on all sides in deed, O All! You are possessed of infinite strength and infinite heroism. You pervade everything; hence You are all!

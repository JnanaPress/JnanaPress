O Pārtha, *esā*, this, the aforesaid; is *brāhmīsthitih*, the state of being established in Brahman, that is, continuing (in life) in indentification with Brahman, after renouncing all actions.

*Na vimuhyati*, one does not become deluded; *prāpya*, after attaining; *enām*, this. *rcchati*, one attains; *brahma-nirvānam*, identification with Brahman, Liberation; *sthitvā*, by being established; *asyām*, in this, in the state of Brahman-hood as described; *api*, even; *anta-kāle*, in the closing years of one's life. What need it be said that, one who remains established only in Brahman during the whole life, after having espoused monasticism even from the stage of celibacy, attains identification with Brahman!

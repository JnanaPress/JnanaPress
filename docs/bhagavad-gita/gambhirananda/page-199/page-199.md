## संयासं कमण कृ ण पुनयगं च शंसिस। येय एतयोरेकं तमे ूिह सुिनितम्॥१॥

(O Krishna,) *śaṁsasi*, You praise, that is speak of; *sannyāsam*, renunciation; *karmanām*, of actions, of performance of various kinds of rites enjoined by the scriptures; *punah ca*, and again; You praise *Yogm*, Yog, the obligatory performance of those very rites!

And hence, *brūhi*, tell; *mām*, me; *suniścitam*, for certain, as the one intended by You; *tat ekam*, that one—one of the two, since performance of the two together by the same person is impossible; *yat*, which; is *śreyah*, better, more commendable; *etayoh*, between these two, between the renunciation of actions and the performance of actions, [\(49\)](#page--1-0) by undertaking which You think I shall acquire what is beneficial.

While stating His own opinion in order to arrive at a conclusion—

## संयास: कमयोग िन:ेयसकरावुभौ। तयोतु कमसंयासाकमयोगो िविशयते॥२॥

*Ubhau*, both, to be sure; *sannyāsah*, renunciation of actions; *ca*, and; *karma-Yogh*, Karma-Yog—their performance—; *nihśreyasakarau*, lead to Liberation. Though both lead to Liberation by virtue of being the cause of the rise of Knowledge, even then, *tayoh*, between the two which are the causes of Liberation; Karma-Yog, *tu*, however;

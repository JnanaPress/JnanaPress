*Uttered a speech*: Though the Sanskrit word *abravīt*, literally said, is enough, its cognate use with *vacanam*, speech, implies that his speech had some hidden motive, or that Duryodhana merely uttered a few words but did not make his intentions clear.

[[3](#page--1-0)] *Camū, vast army*: Technically it is a division of an army consisting of 729 elephants, as many chariots, 2,187 horses, and 3,645 soldiers.—Tr.

*Please see this*: Suspecting that Drona had tender feelings for his beloved disciples, the Pandavas, and might not exert himself fully, the shrewd Duryodhana wanted to enrage him against them by pointing out that they had arrayed themselves opposite to him irrespective of his being their teacher.—Ā.G.

*Disciple*: The word implies that Drona need have no fear of the vast army of the Pandavas, because it was led by one of his disciples. And he as a teacher was surely mightier than the disciple.

*Son of Drupada*: His name was Dhrsṭadyumna. But Duryodhana refers to him as the son of Drupada in order to enrage Drona further, Drupada being the latter's sworn enemy.

*Intelligent*: Therefore he cannot be ignored, though a disciple.

'Besides, Dhrsṭadyumna, though a son of your enemy, was so intelligent that he managed to learn archery from you. So, your carelessness has become the cause of my distress.'

*Of the sons of Pandu*: Instead of being construed with the word 'army', these words can be alternatively connected with 'O teacher'. In that case the shrewd words of Duryodhana will mean that he was taunting Drona of being the teacher of the Pandavas whom he favoured, and not of himself!

tastes)', etc. *Api*, even that; *rasah*, taste of the nature of subtle attachment; *asya*, of this person, of the *sannyāsin*; *nivartate*, falls away, that is, his objective perception becomes seedless; when *drsṭvā*, after attaining; *param*, the Absolute, the Reality which is the supreme Goal, Brahman, he continues in life with the realization, 'I verily am That (Brahman).'

In the absence of full realization there can be no eradication of the 'hankering'. The idea conveyed is that, one should therefore stabilize one's wisdom which is characterized by full realization. [\(98\)](#page--1-0)

Since the organs have to be first brought under his own control by one who desires to establish firmly the wisdom which is characterized by full realization, therefore the Bhagavān speaks of the evil that arises from not keeping them under control:

## यततो िप कौतेय पुषय िवपित:। इियािण माथीिन हरित सभं मन:॥६०॥

60. For, O son of Kuntī, the turbulent organs violently snatch away the mind of an intelligent person, even while he is striving diligently.

*Hi*, for; *kaunteya*, O son of Kuntī; *pramāthīni*, the turbulent; *indriyānī*, organs; *prasabham*, violently; *haranti*, snatch away; *manah*, the mind; *vipaścitah*, of an intelligent; *purusasya*, person; *api*, even; *yatatah*, while he is striving diligently [\(99\)](#page--1-1)—(or,) the words *purusasya vipaścitah* (of an intelligent person) are to be connected with the remote word *api* (even). [\(100\)](#page--1-2) Indeed, the organs confound a person who is inclined towards objects, and after confounding him, violently carry away his mind endowed with discriminating knowledge, even when he is aware of this.

*Since this is so, therefore,*

तािन सविण संयय युत आसीत मपर:। वशे िह ययेियािण तय ा ितिता॥६१॥

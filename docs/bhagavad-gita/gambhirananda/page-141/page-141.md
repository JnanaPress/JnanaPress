## आवृतं ानमेतेन ािननो िनयवैिरणा। कामपेण कौतेय द ु पूरेणानलेन च॥३९॥

39. O son of Kuntī, Knowledge is covered by this constant enemy of the wise in the form of desire, which is an insatiable fire.

*Jñānam*, Knowledge; is *āvrtam*, covered; *etena*, by this; *nityavairinā*, constant enemy; *jñāninah*, of the wise. For the wise person knows even earlier, 'I am being induced by this into evil.' And he always [\(56\)](#page--1-0) feels distressed. Therefore, it is the constant enemy of the wise but not of a fool. For the fool looks upon desire as a friend so long as hankering lasts. When sorrow comes as a consequence, he realizes, 'I have been driven into sorrow because of longings', but certainly not earlier. Therefore it is the constant enemy of the wise alone.

In what form? *Kāma-rūpena*, in the form of desire—that which has wish itself as its expression is *kāma-rūpa*; in that form—; (and) *duspūrena*, which is an insatiable; *analena*, fire. That which is difficult to satisfy is *duspūrah*; and (derivatively) that which never has enough (*alam*) is *analam*.

Again, having what as its abode does desire, in the form of a veil over Knowledge, become the enemy of all? Since when the abode of an enemy is known, it is possible to easily slay the enemy, therefore the Bhagavān says:

## इियािण मनो बुिरयािधानमु यते। एतैिवमोहययेष ानमावृ य देिहनम्॥४०॥

40. The organs, mind, and the intellect are said to be its abode. This one diversely deludes the embodied being by veiling Knowledge with the help of these.

*Indriyāni*, the organs; *manah*, mind; and *buddhih*, the intellect; *ucyate*, are said to be; *asya*, its, desire's; *adhisṭhānam*, abode. *Esāh*, this one, desire; *vimohayati*, diversely deludes; *dehinam*, the

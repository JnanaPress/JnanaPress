(Karma-) Yog; as *prthak*, different, having opposite and different results. The learned ones, the wise, however, admit one, unconflicting result. How? Any one who *samyak*, properly; *āsthitah*, resorts to, that is follows; *ekam api*, even one, between the Path of Knowledge and (Karma-) Yog; *vindate*, gets; *phalam*, the result; *ubhayoh*, of both. For, the result of both is that Liberation itself. Therefore, there is no conflict with regard to the result.

*Objection*: After beginning the topic with the words, 'renunciation' and '(Karma-) Yog', how is it that the Bhagavān speaks of the identity of the results of the path of Knowledge and (Karma-) Yog, which is beside the point?

Although the question was put by Arjuna merely with regard to renunciation and Karma-Yog, yet the Bhagavān, without actually avoiding them, and by adding something special which was intended by Him, gave the answer by expressing them through other words, 'Sānkhya' and '(Karma-) Yog'.

This is the Bhagavān's view. Therefore there is no discussion out of the context.

How can the result of both be attained by the proper performance of only one? The answer is:

5. The State [\(53\)](#page--1-0) that is reached by the Sānkhyas, that is reached by the yogīs as well. He sees who sees Sānkhya and Yog as one.

*Sthānam*, the State called Liberation; *yat prāpyate*, that is reached; *sānkhyaih*, by the Sānkhyas, by the monks steadfast in Knowledge; *tat prāpyate*, that is reached; *Yogih*, by the yogīs; *api*, as well. The yogīs are those who, as a means to the attainment of Knowledge, undertake actions by dedicating them to Bhagavān without seeking any result for themselves. The purport is that, by

supreme Purusa with the help of this very syllable *Om*, as possessed of three letters, ... he is lifted up to the world of Brahmā (Hiranyagarbha) by the Sāma-*mantras*,' (op.cit.5) etc. Again, beginning with '(Tell me of that thing which you see as) different from virtue, different from vice,' it has been stated, 'I tell you briefly of that goal which all the Vedas with one voice propound, which all the austerities speak of, and wishing for which people practise Brahmacarya: it is this, namely *Om*' (Ka.1.2.14–15), etc.

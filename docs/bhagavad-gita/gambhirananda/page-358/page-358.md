*Sthāne*, it is proper;—what is that?—that the *jagat*, world; *prahrsyati*, becomes delighted; *tava prakīrtyā*, by Your praise, by reciting Your greatness and hearing it. This is befitting.

*Ca*, and; since You are the Primal Creator, the Cause, *api*, even; *brahmanah*, of Brahmā, of Hiranyagarbha; therefore, *kasmāt*, why, for what reason; should they *na nameran*, not bow down; *te*, to You; *mahātman*, O exalted One; *garīyase*, who are greater (than all)! Hence, why should these not bow down *ādi-kartre*, to the first

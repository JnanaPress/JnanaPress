## इित म योऽिभजानाित कमिभन स बयते॥१४॥

14. Actions do not taint Me; for Me there is no hankering for the results of actions. One who knows Me thus, does not become bound by actions.

Because of the absence of egoism, those *karmāni*, actions; *na limpanti*, do not taint; *mām*, Me, by becoming the originators of body etc. And *me*, for Me; *na sprhā*, there is no hankering for the results of those actions. But in the case of transmigrating beings, who have self-identification in the form, 'I am the agent', and thirst for actions as also for their results, it is reasonable that actions should taint them. Owing to the absence of these, actions do not taint Me. Anyone else, too, *yah*, who; *abhijānāti*, knows; *mam*, Me; *iti*, thus, as his own Self, and (knows), 'I am not an agent; I have no hankering for the results of actions'; *sah*, he; *na badhyate*, does not become bound; *karmabhih*, by actions. In his case also actions cease to be the originators of body etc. This is the import.

## एवं ावा कृ तं कम पूवरिप मुमुुिभ:। कु कमव तमावं पूव : पूवतरं कृ तम्॥१५॥

15. Having known thus, duties were performed even by the ancient seekers of Liberation. Therefore you undertake action itself as was performed earlier by the ancient ones.

*Jñātvā*, having known; *evam*, thus, that 'I am not an agent; I have no desire for the results of actions'; *karma*, duties; *krtam*, were undertaken; *api*, even; *pūrvaih*, by the ancient; *mumuksubhih*, seekers of Liberation. *Tasmāt*, therefore; *tvam*, you; *kuru*, undertake; *karma*, action; *eva*, itself. You ought not to sit quietly, or even renounce. Therefore, you (undertake actions) because they were performed by the ancients as well—if you have no Self-knowledge, then (undertake actions) for self-purification; or, if you have Selfknowledge, then (undertake actions) in order to prevent people from going astray—, as were *krtam*, performed; *pūrvataram*, earlier;

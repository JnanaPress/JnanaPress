## असौ मया हत: शुहिनये चापरानिप। ईरोऽहमहं भोगी िसोऽहं बलवासुखी॥१४॥

14. 'That enemy has been killed by me, and I shall kill others as well. I am the Bhagavān, I am the enjoyer, I am well-established, mighty and happy.'

*Asau*, that; unconquerable *śatruh*, enemy, named Devadatta; *hatah*, has been killed; *mayā*, by me; and *hanisye*, I shall kill; *aparān*, the other wretched ones. What will these pitiable persons do? There is none equal to me at all. *Aham*, I; am the *īśvarah*, Bhagavān; I am the *bhogī*, enjoyer; and I am *siddhah*, well-established in every respect—I am blessed with sons, and grandsons born of sons and daughters. Not only am I a man, but I am also *balavān*, mighty; and I myself am *sukhī*, happy; others are born to be but a burden to the earth!

## आयोऽिभजनवानिम कोऽयोऽित सदश ृ ो मया। यये दायािम मोिदय इयानिवमोिहता:॥१५॥

15. 'I am rich and high-born; who else is there similar to me? I shall perform sacrifices; I shall give, I shall rejoice,'—thus they are diversely deluded by non-discrimination.

*Āḍhyah*, I am rich in wealth; *abhi-janavān*, high-born in respect of my lineage; my seven generations are endowed with Vedic learning etc. From that point of view also there is none equal to me. *Kah anyah*, who else; *asti*, is there; *sadrśah*, similar; *mayā*, to me? Besides, *yaksye*, I shall perform sacrifices; in respect of sacrifices also I shall defeat others. *Dāsyāmi*, I shall give—to actors and others; *modisye*, I shall rejoice, and I shall derive intense joy. *Iti*, thus; are they *ajñāna-vimohitāh*, diversely deluded by nondiscrimination, subject to various indiscrimination.

## अनकिच े िवाता मोहजालसमावृता:। सता: कामभोगेषु पतित नरके ऽशुचौ॥१६॥

## *CHAPTER 14*

## *THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE THREE GUNAS*

गुणयिवभागयोगः

It has been said that whatever comes into being does so through the association between the field and the Knower of the field. This Chapter commencing with 'I shall speak again of the supreme…,' etc. is begun to show how that happens, or to show that the field and the Knower of the field become the cause of the world while remaining subservient to Bhagavān, but not independently as is held by the Sānkhya school.

It has been stated that 'being seated in Nature' and the association with the qualities are the causes of mundane existence. (This Chapter is begun) also to show with which quality and how the association occurs, and which are the qualities and how they bind; and also because it has to be stated how freedom from the qualities comes about, and what the characteristics of a liberated person are.

*Shri Hari said:*

## परं भूय: वयािम ानान ानमु मम्। यावा मुनय: सव पर िसििमतो गता:॥१॥

1. I shall speak again of the supreme Knowledge, the best of all knowledges, by realizing which all the contemplatives reached the highest Perfection from here.

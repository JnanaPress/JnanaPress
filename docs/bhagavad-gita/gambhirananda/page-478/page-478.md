Bhagavān is known. The idea is that nobody's duties become fulfilled in any other way. And it has been said, 'O son of Prthā, all actions in their totality culminate in Knowledge' (4.33). There is also a saying from Manu:

'This, verily, is the fulfilment of a Brāhmana in particular. For, by getting this, a twice-born has his duties fulfilled; not otherwise' (Ma. Sm. 12.93).

Since you have heard from Me this truth about the supreme Reality, therefore, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, you have achieved your Goal!

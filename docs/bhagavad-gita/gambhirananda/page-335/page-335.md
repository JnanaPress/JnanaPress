42. Or, on the other hand, what is the need of your knowing this extensively, O Arjuna? I remain sustaining this whole creation in a special way with a part (of Myself).

*Athavā*, or, on the other hand; *kim*, what is the need; of *tava jñātena*, your knowing; *etena bahunā*, this extensively—but incompletely—in the above manner, O Arjuna? You listen to this subject that is going to be stated in its fullness: *Aham*, I; *sthitah*, remain; *visṭabhya*, sustaining, supporting, holding firmly, in a special way; *idam*, this; *krtsnam*, whole; *jagat*, creation; *ekāṁśena*, by a part, by a *foot [\(37\)](#page--1-0)* (of Myself), that is as the Self of all things [\(38\)](#page--1-1). The Vedic text, 'All beings form a *foot* of His' (rg., Pu. Sū. 10.90.3; Tai. Ār. 3.12.3) supports this. [\(39\)](#page--1-2)

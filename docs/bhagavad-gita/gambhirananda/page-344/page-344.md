An illustration is once more being given of the effulgence of the Cosmic form of the Bhagavān:

## िदिव सूयसहय भवे ुगपदि ु थता। यिद भा: सदश ृ ी सा याासतय महामन:॥१२॥

12. Should the effulgence of a thousand suns blaze forth simultaneously in the sky, that might be similar to the radiance of that exalted One.

Should the *bhāh*, effulgence; *sūrya-sahasrasya*, of a thousand suns; *utthitā bhavet*, blaze forth; *yugapat*, simultaneously; *divi*, in the sky, or in heaven which is the third as counted (from this earth); *sā*, that; *yadi syāt*, might be—or it might not be—; *sadrśī*, similar; to the *bhāsah*, radiance; *tasya*, of that; *mahāt-manah*, exalted One, the Cosmic Person Himself. The idea is that the brilliance of the Cosmic Person surely excels even this!

Further,

## तैकथं जगकृ नं िवभतमनके धा। अपयेवदेवय शरीरे पाडवतदा॥१३॥

13. At that time, Pandava saw there, in the body of the Bhagavān of gods, the whole diversely differentiated Universe united in the one (Cosmic form).

*Tadā*, at that time; *Pandavah*, Pandava, Arjuna; *apaśyat*, saw; *tatra*, there, in that Cosmic form; *śarīre*, in the body; *devadevasya*, of the Bhagavān of gods, of Hari; *krtsnam*, the whole; *jagat*, Universe; *anekadhā*, diversely; *pravibhaktam*, differentiated—into groups of gods, manes, human beings, and others; *ekastham*, united in the one (Cosmic form).

> तत: स िवमयािवो ह ृ रोमा धनय:। णय िशरसा देवं कृ तािलरभाषत॥१४॥

a means to the human ends; and *nivrttim*, what is not to be done, the opposite of that (former) and from which source of evil one should desist. Not only do they not know what is to be done and what is not to be done, *na*, nor; does *śaucam*, purity; *na api*, or even; *ācārah*, good conduct; or *satyam*, truthfulness; *vidyate*, exist; *tesu*, in them. The demons are verily bereft of purity and good conduct; they are deceitful and given to speaking lies.

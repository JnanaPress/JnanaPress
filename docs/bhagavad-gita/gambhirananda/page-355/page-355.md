*Asmi*, I am; the *loka-ksaya-krt*, world-destroying; *kālah*, Time; *pravrddhah*, grown in stature. Hear the purpose for which I have grown in stature: I am *iha*, now; *pravrttah*, engaged; *samāhartum*, in annihilating; *lokān*, the creatures. *Api*, even; *rte tvā*, without you; *sarve*, all—from whom your apprehension had arisen; the *yodhāh*, warriors—Bhishma, Drona, Karna and others; *ye*, who are; *avasthitāh*, arrayed; *pratyanīkesu*, in the confronting armies—in every unit of the army confronting the other; *na bhavisyanti*, will cease to exist.

Since this is so—

## तमावमुि यशो लभव िजवा शून् भुव रायं समृम्। मयैवैते िनहता: पूवमेव िनिममां भव सयसािचन्॥३३॥

33. Therefore you rise up, (and) gain fame; and defeating the enemies, enjoy a prosperous kingdom. These have been killed verily by Me even earlier; be you merely an instrument, O Savyasācin (Arjuna).

*Tasmāt*, therefore; *tvam*, you; *uttisṭha*, rise up; (and) *labhasva*, gain; the *yaśah*, fame, that Arjuna has conquered the *Atirathas*, [\(50\)](#page--1-0) Bhishma, Drona and others, who are unconquerable even by the gods. Such fame can be acquired only by virtuous actions. *Jitvā*, by defeating; *śatrūn*, the enemies, Duryodhana and others; *bhunksva*, enjoy; a *rājyam*, kingdom; that is *samrddham*, prosperous, free from enemies and obstacles. *Ete*, these; *nihatāh*, have been definitely killed, made lifeless; *eva mayā*, verily by Me; *eva pūrvam*, even earlier. *Bhava*, be you; *nimitta-mātram*, merely an instrument, O Savyasāchin. Arjuna was called so because he could shoot arrows even with his left hand.

superimposition of the idea of Visnu on images. Therefore this verse bears the meaning just as it has been already explained.

As to that, after having presented Knowledge as a sacrifice, other sacrifices also are being mentioned now in the verses beginning with, '(Other yogīs undertake) sacrifice to gods alone,' etc., for eulogizing that Knowledge:

## दैवमेवापरे यं योिगन: पयु पासते। ानावपरे यं येनवै ोपजुित॥२५॥

25. Other yogīs undertake sacrifice to gods alone. Others offer the Self, as a sacrifice by the Self itself, in the fire of Brahman.

*Apare*, other; *yogīnah*, yogīs, ritualists; *pari-upāsate*, undertake; *yajñam*, sacrifice; *daivam*, to gods; *eva*, alone.

A sacrifice by which the gods are adored is *daiva-yajña*; they perform only that. This is the meaning.

*Brahma-agnau*, in the fire of Brahman: By the word *brahman* is meant That which is referred to in such sentences as, 'Brahman is Truth, Knowledge and Infinite' (Tai. 2.1), 'Knowledge, Bliss, Brahman' (Br. 3.9.28), 'the Brahman that is immediate and direct the self that is within all' (Br.3.4.1), which is devoid of all worldly characteristics like hunger etc. and which is beyond all particular qualifications—as stated in, 'Not this, not this' (Br. 4.4.22). That which is Brahman is the fire. [\(28\)](#page--1-0) And it is spoken of as Brahmāgni with a view to referring to It as that into which the offering is made.

In that fire of Brahman, *apare*, others, other knowers of Brahman; *upa-juhvati*, offer; *yajñam*, the Self, which is referred to by the word *yajña* (sacrifice), it having been presented as a synonym of the Self; —that Self, which is a sacrifice, which in reality is verily the supreme Brahman, which is associated with such limiting adjuncts as the intellect etc., which is associated with all the qualities of the limiting adjuncts superimposed on it, and which is the oblation, (they offer) *yajñena*, by the Self itself as described above. The offering (of the Self) in that (Brahman) is nothing but the realization of that Self

## योगी युीत सततमामानं रहिस िथत:। एकाकी यतिचामा िनराशीरपिरह:॥१०॥

10. A yogī should constantly concentrate his mind by staying in a solitary place, alone, with mind and body controlled, free from expectations, (and) free from acquisition.

A *yogī*, a man of meditation; *satatam yuñjīta*, should constantly concentrate; *ātmānam*, his mind; *sthitah*, by staying; *rahasi*, in a solitary place, in mountain caves etc.; *ekākī*, alone, without any companion; *yata-citta-ātmā*, with mind and body controlled; *nirāśīh*, without expectations, free from hankering; and *aparigrahah*, free from acquisition.

From the use of the qualifying words, 'in a solitary place' and 'alone', it follows that (he has to undertake all these) after espousing monasticism. And even after renunciation, he should concentrate his mind by desisting from all acquisition. This is the meaning.

Now then have to be stated the rules regarding seat, food, movements, etc. as disciplines for Yog in the case of one practising concentration; as also the signs of one who has succeeded in Yog, and the consequent result etc. Hence this is begun. Among these, the *seat* is being first spoken of:

शुचौ देशे िताय िथरमासनमामन:। नायुितं नाितनीचं चैलािजनकु शोरम्॥११॥ तैकां मन: कृ वा यतिचेियिय:। उपिवयासने यु याोगमामिवशुये॥१२॥

11. Having firmly established in a clean place his seat, neither too high nor too low, and made of cloth, skin and *kuśa*-grass, placed successively one below the other;

12. (and) sitting on that seat, he should concentrate his mind for the purification of the internal organ, making the mind one-pointed and keeping the actions of the mind and senses under control.

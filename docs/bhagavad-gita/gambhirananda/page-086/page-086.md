The idea is that the man of steady wisdom is a monk, who has renounced the desire for progeny, wealth and the worlds, and who delights in the Self and disports in the Self.

## द: ु खेवनुिनमना: सुखेषु िवगतपृह:। वीतरागभयोध: िथतधीमु िनयते॥५६॥

56. That monk is called a man of steady wisdom when his mind is unperturbed in sorrow, he is free from longing for delights, and has gone beyond attachment, fear and anger.

Moreover, that *munih*, monk; [\(94\)](#page--1-0) *ucyate*, is then called; *sthitadhīh*, a man of steady wisdom; when *anudvignamanāh*, his mind is unperturbed; *duhkhesu*, in sorrow—when his mind remains unperturbed by the sorrows that may come on the physical or other planes [\(95\)](#page--1-1)—; so also, when he is *vigata*-*sprhah*, free from longing; *sukhesu*, for delights—when he, unlike fire which flares up when fed with fuel etc., has no longing for delights when they come to him—; and *vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhah*, has gone beyond attachment, fear, and anger.

## य: सवानिभनहे ताय शुभाशुभम्। नािभनदित न ेि तय ा ितिता॥५७॥

57. The wisdom of that person remains established who has not attachment for anything anywhere, who neither welcomes nor rejects anything whatever good or bad when he comes across it.

Further, *prajñā*, the wisdom; *tasya*, of that person, of that *sannyāsin*; *pratisṭhitā*, remains established; *yah*, who; *anabhisnehah*, has no attachment for; *sarvatra*, anything anywhere, even for body, life, etc.; who *na abhinandati*, neither welcomes; *na dvesṭi*, nor rejects; *tat tat*, anything whatever; *śubha-aśubham*, good or bad; *prāpya*, when he comes across it, that is, who does not rejoice on meeting with the good, nor reject the bad on meeting with it. Of such a person, who is thus free from elation or dejection, the wisdom arising from discrimination remains established.

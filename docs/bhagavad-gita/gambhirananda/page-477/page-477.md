*Bhārata*, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; *yah*, he who; *asammūḍhah*, being free from delusion; *jānāti*, knows; *mām*, Me, Bhagavān, having the aforesaid qualifications; *purusottamam*, the supreme Person; *evam*, thus, in the way described, as 'I am this One'; *sah*, he; is *sarva-vit*, all-knowing—he knows everything through self-identification with all—, i.e. (he becomes) omniscient; and *bhajati*, adores; *mām*, Me, existing in all things; *sarva-bhāvena*, with his whole being, that is with his mind fixed on Me as the Self of all.

*darśanah*, who has the vision of sameness everywhere—who has the vision (*darśana*) of sameness (*sama-tva*), the knowledge of identity of the Self and Brahman everywhere (*sarvatra*) without exception, in all divergent objects beginning from Brahmā to immovable things; *īksate*, sees; *ātmānam*, the Self, his own Self; *sarva-bhūta-stham*, existing in everything; and *sarva-bhūtāni*, everything from Brahma to a clump of grass; unified *ātmani*, in his Self.

The fruit of this realization of the unity of the Self is being stated:

## यो म पयित सव सवं च मिय पयित। तयाहं न णयािम स च मे न णयित॥३०॥

## सवभूतिथतं यो म भजयेकवमािथत:। सवथा वतमानोऽिप स योगी मिय वतते॥३१॥

31. That yogī who, being established in unity, adores Me as existing in all things, he exists in Me in whatever condition he may be.

This being so, that is after reiterating (in the first line of the present verse) the idea of full realization contained in the previous verse, the result of that (realization), namely Liberation, is being

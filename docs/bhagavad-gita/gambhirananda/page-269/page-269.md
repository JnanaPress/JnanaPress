completely bewildered person whose intelligence has been overcome by them.

Therefore, *bhārata*, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; owing to that delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes, *sarvabhūtāni*, all creatures become deluded. *Parantapa*, O destroyer of foes; they *yānti sammoham*, become bewildered, come under delusion; *sarge*, at the time of their birth, that is at the time of their origination. The idea is that all creatures that come into being do so prepossessed by delusion. 'Since this is so, therefore all creatures, being deluded and having their wisdom obstructed by that delusion of duality, do not know Me who am their Self. Hence, they do not adore Me as their Self.'

'Who, again, are those that, becoming free from the delusion of duality, come to know You, and adore You as the Self in accordance with the scriptures?'

28. On the other hand, those persons who are of virtuous deeds, whose sin has come to an end, they, being free from the delusion of duality and firm in their convictions, adore Me.

*Yesām janānām*, those persons; *tu*, on the other hand; *punyakarmanām*, who are of virtuous deeds, in whom exist virtuous deeds that are the cause of purification of the mind; whose *pāpam*, sin; *antagatam*, has come to an end, is almost eradicated, attenuated; *te*, they; *dvandva-moha-nirmuktāh*, being free from the delusion of duality as described; and *drḍhavratāh*, firm in their convictions those who [\(108\)](#page--1-0) have the firm knowledge that the supreme Reality is such alone and not otherwise are called *drḍhavratāh*—; *bhajante*, adore; *mām*, Me, the supreme Self.

Why do they worship? This is being answered:

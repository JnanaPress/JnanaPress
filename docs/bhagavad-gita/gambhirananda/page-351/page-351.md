(that is) possessed of many frightening forms; *vyātta-ānanam*, openmouthed; *dīpta-viśāla-netram*, with fiery large eyes; I, *pravyathitaantara-ātmā*, becoming terrified in my mind; *na vindāmi*, do not find; *dhrtim*, steadiness; *ca*, and; *śamam*, peace, calmness of mind.

Why?

## दंाकरालािन च ते मुखािन द ृ वैव कालानलसिभािन। िदशो न जाने न लभे च शम सीद देवेश जगिवास॥२५॥

25. Having merely seen Your mouths made terrible with (their) teeth and resembling the fire of Dissolution, I have lost the sense of direction and find no comfort. Be gracious, O Bhagavān of gods, O Abode of the Universe.

*Drsṭvā eva*, having merely seen; *te*, Your; *mukhāni*, mouths; *daṁsṭrā-karālāni*, made terrible with (their) teeth; and *kāla-analasannibhāni*, resembling the fire of Dissolution—the fire that burns the worlds at the time of Dissolution is *kālānala*; similar to that; *na jāne*, I have lost; the sense of *diśah*, direction—I do not know the directions as to which is East or which is West; and hence, *na labhe*, find no; *śarma*, comfort. Therefore, *prasīda*, be gracious; *deveśa*, O Bhagavān of gods; *jagannivāsa*, O Abode of the Universe!

'The apprehension which was there of my getting defeated by those others, that too has cleared away, since—'

> अमी च व धृतराय पुा: सव सहैवाविनपालसै :। भीमो ोण: सूतपुतथासौ सहामदीयैरिप योधमु यै :॥२६॥

26. And into You (enter) all those sons of Dhritarashtra along with multitudes of the rulers of the earth; (also) Bhishma, Drona and that son of a Sūta (Karna), together with even our prominent warriors.

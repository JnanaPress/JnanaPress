61. O Arjuna, the Bhagavān resides in the region of the heart of all creatures, revolving through Māyā all the creatures (as though) mounted on a machine!

*Arjuna*, O Arjuna—one whose self is naturally white (pure), that is one possessing a pure internal organ. This follows from the Vedic text, 'The day is dark and the day is *arjuna* (white) (rg. 6.9.1). *Iśvarah*, the Bhagavān, Nārāyana the Ruler; *tisṭhati*, resides, remains seated; *hrd-deśe*, in the region of the heart; *sarvabhūtānām*, of all creatures, of all living beings. How does He reside? In answer the Bhagavān says: *bhrāmayan*, revolving; *māyayā*, through Māyā, through delusion; *sarva-bhūtāni*, all the creatures; as though *yantra-ārūḍhāni*, mounted on a machine—like man' etc., made of wood, mounted on a machine. The word *iva* (as though) has to be thus understood here. *Bhrāmayan*, revolving, is to be connected with *tisṭhati*, resides (conveying the idea, 'resides...while revolving').

62. Take refuge in Him alone with your whole being, O scion of the Bharata dynasty. Through His grace you will attain the supreme Peace and the eternal Abode.

*Gaccha śaranam*, take refuge; *tam eva*, in Him, the Bhagavān alone; *sarva-bhāvena*, with your whole being, for getting rid of your mundane sufferings, O scion of the Bharata dynasty. *Tat-prasādāt*, through His grace, through Bhagavān's grace; *prāpsyasi*, you will attain; *parām*, the supreme; *śāntim*, Peace, the highest Tranquillity; and the *śāśvatam*, eternal; *sthānam*, Abode, the supreme State of Mine who am Visnu.
